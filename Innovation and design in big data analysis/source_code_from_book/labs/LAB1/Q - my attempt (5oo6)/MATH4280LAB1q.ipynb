    "One can easily estimate pi value by implementing simple simulation experiments. We apply basic monte carlo method to approximate the real value of pi. The main story of the experiment is if we have a perfectly fit circle in a square, and if we start to toss coins inside to this square, at the end, how many coins would we have in the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment will help us to approximate the real pi value. Assuming \"r\" to be the radius of the circle and \"2r\" to be the length of the sides of the square, the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square will be “π/4”. This means that the ratio of the number of coins inside the circle to the total number of coins we toss(n) is also approaching “π/4” as we increase the our experiment size “$n$”( total #of tosses).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each trial, first generate random $(x,y)$ from -10000 to 10000, then check whether the Euclidean distance from the input $(x,y)$ to $(0,0)$ is smaller than 10000. If yes, the point is inside the circle. Hence, $\\frac{4\\times \\text{number inside circle}}{\\text{number of trials}}$  will approximate the pi value. Write a script to perform the above monte carlo method for $n=1000$. Also, print out the approximate value of $\\pi$.\n",
