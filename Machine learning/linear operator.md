In [[Dynamic mode decomposition|DMD]], We have $X' = AX$. And we describe the multiplication of $A$ as "linear operator $A$."

Linear operators exend beyond matrices transformations
- Matrix transformation
- Other transformations that cannot easily be represented by matrices
	- Differential operators
	- Integral operators

In the context of differential geometry, the notion of linear operator is particularly relevant. 
- Differential operators (like gradient, divergence, curl) are often described as linear operators because they act on functions or vector fields in a way that satisfies the linearity property. 
- These operators are not easily captured by finite matrices since they often involves derivatives and operate on infinite-dimensional spaces.

- Q: in DMD, why we describe A is "linear operator", instead of just a matrix?

In the context of mathematics and specifically linear algebra, the distinction between describing a transformation or operation as a "linear operator" versus merely a matrix lies in the level of abstraction and generality.

A matrix is a concrete representation of a linear transformation in a particular basis. When we have a finite-dimensional vector space, we can represent a linear transformation by a matrix with respect to some basis. This matrix representation allows us to perform computations efficiently, especially when dealing with systems of linear equations or transformations between vector spaces with a known basis.

However, a linear operator is a more abstract concept. It refers to a function that maps elements from one vector space to another, preserving the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. Linear operators encompass the idea of transformations without being tied to any particular basis or matrix representation. They can be represented by matrices in specific cases where bases are defined, but they extend beyond matrices to include various transformations that may not be easily represented by matrices, such as differential operators, integral operators, and more.

In the context of Differential Geometry, for instance, the notion of a linear operator is particularly relevant. Differential operators (like gradient, divergence, curl) are often described as linear operators because they act on functions or vector fields in a way that satisfies the linearity property. These operators are not easily captured by finite matrices since they often involve derivatives and operate on infinite-dimensional spaces.

Describing a transformation as a linear operator emphasizes its fundamental propertiesâ€”linearity, preserving vector space structure, and abstraction from any particular representation such as matrices. This abstraction allows for a deeper understanding and more general applicability across various mathematical settings beyond finite-dimensional spaces.
