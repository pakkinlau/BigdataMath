1. **Introduction to Variables:**
   - In linear algebra, variables are fundamental to solving systems of linear equations. These equations typically involve several unknowns, and these unknowns are represented as variables.

2. **Definition of Free Variable:**
   - A free variable is a variable in a [[systems of linear equations|systems of linear equation]] that is not restricted by any particular equation. In other words, it is a variable that can take on any value without violating the constraints imposed by the equations.
   - Say the dimension of the nullspace is bigger than 0. Then we can use the row space equations to express free variables and pick $n-r$  random points

3. **[[Under-determined|Underdetermined]] Systems:**
   - Free variables are especially relevant in the context of underdetermined systems of linear equations. An underdetermined system is one in which there are more variables than equations.
   - When dealing with such systems, not all variables can be uniquely determined. Some variables are free to take on any value, hence the name "free variable."

4. **Example:**
   - Consider the following system of linear equations:
     ```
     2x + y = 5
     3x + 2y = 8
     ```
   - In this case, you can solve for y in terms of x from the first equation (y = 5 - 2x). However, x remains undetermined and can take on any value. Therefore, x is a free variable in this system.

5. **Role of Free Variables:**
   - Free variables play a crucial role in parametric representations of solutions to systems of linear equations. They allow us to express solutions in terms of these variables and understand the entire solution space.

6. **Solution Space:**
   - The solution to a system of linear equations with free variables is not a single point but a subspace in n-dimensional space (where n is the number of variables).
   - Free variables parameterize this subspace, giving us a way to describe all possible solutions.

7. **Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF):**
   - When solving systems of linear equations and reducing the augmented matrix to its RREF, free variables correspond to columns without leading 1's. These columns represent variables that are not constrained by the equations.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Free variables are an important concept in linear algebra, especially when dealing with underdetermined systems. They represent the degrees of freedom in the solution space and help us understand the range of possible solutions to a system of linear equations.
