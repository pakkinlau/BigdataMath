In linear algebra, both the terms "[[basis]]" and "eigenbasis" are related to [[vector space]]s, but they serve different purposes and have distinct definitions:

1. Basis:
    
    - A basis for a vector space is a set of vectors that are linearly independent and span the entire vector space.
    - Linearly independent means that no vector in the basis can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. In other words, there are no non-zero coefficients that can make a linear combination equal to the zero vector.
    - Spanning means that any vector in the vector space can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis.
    - The number of vectors in a basis is called the dimension of the vector space. Different bases for the same vector space will have the same dimension.
2. Eigenbasis:
    
    - An eigenbasis is a specific type of basis associated with a [[square matrix]] (usually referred to as an operator or transformation matrix).
    - It is formed by the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors]] of the matrix, which are special vectors that remain in the same direction (up to scaling) when multiplied by the matrix.
    - An operator's eigenbasis consists of its eigenvectors, and if the matrix is [[diagonalization]] (which is not always the case), the eigenbasis can be used to diagonalize the matrix, making certain calculations and transformations easier.
    - The eigenbasis is particularly important in the context of diagonalization, spectral decomposition, and solving linear differential equations.

In summary, while a basis is a set of vectors that form the foundation of a vector space by spanning it and being linearly independent, an eigenbasis is a special basis formed by the eigenvectors of a square matrix, often used for specific mathematical operations and transformations related to that matrix. Eigenbases are a subset of all possible bases for a given vector space, and not all matrices have an eigenbasis.
