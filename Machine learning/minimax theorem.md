Certainly, let's enhance the notes by providing demonstrations of each point discussed:

**Introduction to Game Theory:**
Game theory is a formal mathematical discipline concerned with the analysis of strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. It provides a framework to model and analyze situations where the outcome of one agent depends on the choices made by others.

*Demonstration:*
Imagine two companies, A and B, competing for market share. They need to decide on their pricing strategies. The profit of each company depends on not only their pricing but also the pricing strategy of their competitor. This scenario can be analyzed using game theory.

**Definition of Minimax Theorem:**
The Minimax Theorem is a fundamental principle in game theory that addresses two-player, zero-sum games, which are characterized by the following:
- Two players: Player A (the maximizer) and Player B (the minimizer).
- Zero-sum nature: The total gain of one player is equal to the total loss of the other player.
Formally, in a zero-sum game, Player A aims to maximize their utility, denoted as U(A), while Player B aims to minimize it, denoted as U(B).

*Demonstration:*
Let's consider a simple example of a zero-sum game, like Rock-Paper-Scissors, where one player's win is another player's loss. Player A tries to maximize their chance of winning, while Player B tries to minimize Player A's chance of winning.

**Objective of Minimax Theorem:**
The Minimax Theorem seeks to find strategies for Player A and Player B such that, in equilibrium, Player A's maximum possible utility is minimized, and Player B's minimum possible utility is maximized.

*Demonstration:*
In a poker game, Player A (the aggressive player) aims to maximize their chip winnings, while Player B (the cautious player) aims to minimize their chip losses. The Minimax Theorem helps determine the optimal strategies for both players to achieve their objectives in a balanced way.

**Mathematical Representation:**
For a zero-sum game, the Minimax Theorem can be expressed as follows:
Maximize U(A) such that min U(B) is maximized.
This translates to Player A choosing a strategy that maximizes their worst-case outcome, assuming Player B selects a strategy to minimize Player A's best-case outcome.

*Demonstration:*
In a game of chess, Player A considers various moves and evaluates them in terms of the worst-case scenario, where Player B makes the most favorable move for them. Player A selects the move that maximizes their advantage in this worst-case scenario.

**Solving Zero-Sum Games:**
To solve zero-sum games using the Minimax Theorem, a payoff matrix is constructed. This matrix represents the utilities or payoffs to Player A and Player B for each possible combination of strategies. Player A then employs a strategy that maximizes their minimum possible utility, and Player B selects a strategy that minimizes Player A's maximum possible utility.

*Demonstration:*
Consider a simplified payoff matrix for a game of soccer penalties. Player A (the penalty taker) decides where to kick the ball, and Player B (the goalkeeper) decides where to dive. The matrix shows the outcomes (goals or saves) for each combination of strategies, and both players use the Minimax strategy to maximize their chances.

**Nash Equilibrium:**
The outcome derived from the Minimax Theorem often corresponds to a Nash equilibrium, which is a state in which neither player can improve their utility by unilaterally changing their strategy. In a Nash equilibrium, both players are playing optimally given their knowledge of each other's strategies.

*Demonstration:*
In the classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario, both prisoners (Player A and Player B) are given the option to cooperate or betray each other. The Nash equilibrium is reached when both players choose to betray, as neither can improve their situation by changing their strategy if the other maintains their choice.

**Applications of Minimax Theorem:**
The Minimax Theorem finds applications in various domains, including economics, political science, and artificial intelligence. It is particularly important in decision-making algorithms for games where strategic interactions occur.

*Demonstration:*
In the field of artificial intelligence, the Minimax algorithm is commonly used in game-playing programs like chess engines. These programs analyze possible moves, apply the Minimax strategy to find the best move, and make decisions accordingly.

**Limitations:**
The Minimax Theorem assumes that both players have complete information about the game, including knowledge of each other's strategies and rationality. Real-world scenarios often involve incomplete information and behavioral complexities that may deviate from the strict assumptions of the theorem.

*Demonstration:*
In a real-world negotiation, one party may not have complete information about the other party's preferences or intentions. This lack of information can lead to deviations from the idealized assumptions of perfect rationality and complete knowledge assumed by the Minimax Theorem.
