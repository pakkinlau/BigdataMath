**Concept: Projection Operator $\hat Q_{j-1}\hat Q_{j-1}^*$ in Linear Algebra**

**Definition:**
In linear algebra, the projection operator $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ is a mathematical construct used to project vectors onto a subspace. Let's break down the components of this operator:

1. **$\hat Q_{j-1}$:** This represents a linear transformation or operator that projects vectors onto a subspace associated with the index $j-1$.

2. **$\hat Q_{j-1}^*$:** The superscript $^*$ denotes the conjugate transpose (also known as the adjoint or Hermitian transpose) of the operator $\hat Q_{j-1}$. This involves taking the transpose of the operator and then conjugating its entries.

## Understanding projection operator

To understand how the expression $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ arises for a projection operator, let's consider the steps involved in constructing such an operator. The key concept is to project vectors onto a subspace associated with $\hat Q_{j-1}$.

Here are the steps:

1. **Start with the Projection Operator $\hat Q_{j-1}$:**
   - The operator $\hat Q_{j-1}$ itself is a projection operator onto a subspace. It takes a vector and projects it onto the subspace associated with the index $j-1$.

2. **Consider the Adjoint (Conjugate Transpose) $\hat Q_{j-1}^*$:**
   - The adjoint, denoted by $\hat Q_{j-1}^*$, is obtained by taking the conjugate transpose of $\hat Q_{j-1}$. In other words, if $\hat Q_{j-1}$ has entries $q_{ij}$, then the entries of $\hat Q_{j-1}^*$ are $\bar{q}_{ji}$, where $\bar{q}$ denotes the complex conjugate.

3. **Combine $\hat Q_{j-1}$ and $\hat Q_{j-1}^*$:**
   - The product $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ is formed by multiplying $\hat Q_{j-1}$ with its adjoint $\hat Q_{j-1}^*$.

4. **Analyze the Result:**
   - The product $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ possesses certain properties, one of which is self-adjointness. This means that $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ is equal to its own conjugate transpose.

**Explanation:**
When $\hat Q_{j-1}$ projects a vector onto a subspace, its adjoint $\hat Q_{j-1}^*$ essentially deals with the "backwards" transformation, accounting for the complex conjugation. Combining them in the product $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ ensures that the projection and its adjoint work together seamlessly, resulting in a self-adjoint operator.

In summary, the expression $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ for a projection operator arises from the natural combination of a projection operator and its adjoint, guaranteeing certain mathematical properties that are useful in various applications within linear algebra and related fields.
