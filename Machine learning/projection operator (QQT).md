$Q_j Q_j^*$ and $qq^*$ appears very often in linear algebra. What are their meaning? 

- $qq^*$: 
	- This is known as the [outer product](outer%20product.md) of $q$ itself. This operation represents a linear transformation that scales vectors in the direction of $q$ by the length of $q$. 
- $Q_j Q_j^*$: 
	- It produces a matrix that represents a projection operation onto the subspace defined by $Q_j$. 
	- In [projector](projector.md), Since $P$ is unit length sized, and $P$ can be decomposed to be $P = Q \Sigma Q^*$, we can say that $P$ is normal 
	- You can also connect this concept with $qq^*$ ([outer product](outer%20product.md)). It can be think as a sum of outer products: $QQ^* = q_1q_1^* + \dots + q_n q_n^*$
- **$\hat Q$:** A single unitary column matrix represents a direction in the vector space. When we multiply a vector by $Q$, we potentially changing direction and magnitude of that veetor. 
- $Q^*$:  The adjoint $\hat Q_{j-1}^*$ essentially deals with the "backwards" transformation, accounting for the complex conjugation. Combining them in the product $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ ensures that the projection and its adjoint work together seamlessly, resulting in a self-adjoint operator.

## Occurrence of projection operator ($QQ^*$) in computational mathematics:
- 
- [Modified Gram-Schmidt iteration](Modified%20Gram-Schmidt%20iteration.md): $P_j = I - Q_{j-1} Q_{j-1}^*$, where $Q_{j-1}$ is $m \times (j-1)$ matrix containing the first $j-1$ columns of $Q$.

**Projection Operator Properties:**

1. **Self-Adjointness:**
   - The combination $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ is self-adjoint, meaning it is equal to its own conjugate transpose.

2. **Projection onto Subspace:**
   - When applied to a vector, the operator $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ projects the vector onto the subspace associated with $\hat Q_{j-1}$.

**Applications:**

1. **Signal Processing:**
   - In signal processing, projection operators are used to extract specific components or features from signals.

2. **Quantum Mechanics:**
   - Projection operators play a crucial role in quantum mechanics, representing measurements and states of quantum systems.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - In data analysis, projection operators can be employed for dimensionality reduction or feature selection.

**Example:**
Consider a vector $v$ and a subspace defined by $\hat Q_{j-1}$. The action of $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ on $v$ results in the projection of $v$ onto the subspace associated with $\hat Q_{j-1}$.

**Conclusion:**
The projection operator $\hat Q_{j-1} \hat Q_{j-1}^*$ is a powerful tool in linear algebra, facilitating the analysis and manipulation of vectors within specific subspaces. Its properties make it valuable in various mathematical and scientific disciplines, contributing to a deeper understanding of vector spaces and transformations.
