Absolutely, let's add some mathematical notation to clarify the concept of eigenspaces in linear algebra.

### Eigenspace in Linear Algebra

- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:** Given a square matrix $A$, an eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ and its corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$ satisfy the equation:
$$ A\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}$$

- **Definition of Eigenspace:** For an eigenvalue $\lambda$, the eigenspace $E_{\lambda}$ is defined as:
$$ E_{\lambda} = \{\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n : A\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}\} \cup \{\mathbf{0}\}$$

  Here, $\mathbb{R}^n$ represents the vector space associated with $A$, and $\mathbf{0}$ is the zero vector.

- **Multiplicity of Eigenvalues:** If an eigenvalue $\lambda$ has $k$ linearly independent eigenvectors, then the dimension of the eigenspace $E_{\lambda}$ is $k$.

- **Linear Transformation Interpretation:** For a linear transformation represented by matrix $A$, eigenvectors represent directions that are only scaled by the transformation $A$, and the eigenspace $E_{\lambda}$ for eigenvalue $\lambda$ corresponds to the subspace of vectors transformed only by scalar multiplication by $\lambda$.

- **Basis of Eigenspaces:** Eigenspaces are subspaces, so they are closed under addition and scalar multiplication. If $\lambda$ has $k$ linearly independent eigenvectors, these form a basis for the eigenspace $E_{\lambda}$.

- **Diagonalization:** Diagonalization of a matrix $A$ involves finding a basis of eigenvectors. If $A$ has $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n$, then the matrix $P$ formed by these eigenvectors becomes the diagonalizing matrix, and $P^{-1}AP$ is a diagonal matrix.

Mathematical notation helps in precisely defining eigenspaces and their relationship with eigenvalues and eigenvectors within the framework of linear transformations represented by matrices.
