- In [[Projection formula]], outer product is used to perform transformation any vector $x$ into the space spanned by $v$. In specific, if $v$ is unit vector, then $vv^H$ project any $x$ onto $v$, that is, $$vv^H x = \frac{v \cdot v}{||v||^2} v = proj_v(x)$$, if $||v||  = 1$. 

- It is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and produces a matrix. Like, a two $3 \times 1$ vector will produce a $3 \times 3$ matrix. 
- In physical meaning, it describe relationships between different quantities or directions in a space. 

- How it represent "relationship between different quantities or directions in space"?
- $$\mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v} =
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1v_1 & u_1v_2 & u_1v_3 \\
u_2v_1 & u_2v_2 & u_2v_3 \\
u_3v_1 & u_3v_2 & u_3v_3 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
- $\mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v}$ can be considered as a transformation matrix that transforms vectors of the form $\mathbf{v}$ into a space represented by $\mathbf{u}$.

- Another example: 
- $$(\mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{v})x = proj_v(x)$$
- $\mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{v}$ produces a transformation matrix that encapsulates the directional information of $\mathbf{v}$.
- Multiplying this transformation matrix by $\mathbf{x}$ aligns $\mathbf{x}$ with the space defined by $\mathbf{v}$, effectively projecting $\mathbf{x}$ onto the direction of $\mathbf{v}$.

This operation effectively expresses $\text{proj}_{\mathbf{v}}(\mathbf{x})$, the projection of $\mathbf{x}$ onto the direction of $\mathbf{v}$, showcasing the relationship between $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ in the context of their directions in space.

Absolutely! In linear algebra, the outer product is a fundamental operation used to combine two vectors to create a matrix. Let's say you have two vectors, **A** and **B**.

The outer product of vectors **A** and **B** results in a matrix, often denoted as **C** = **A**âŠ—**B**. This matrix has dimensions m x n, where m is the length of vector **A** and n is the length of vector **B**.

Here's how it works: Each element $c_{ij}$ of the resulting matrix **C** is calculated by multiplying the $i^{th}$ element of vector **A** by the $j^{th}$ element of vector **B**.

Mathematically, if **A** is an m-dimensional column vector and **B** is an n-dimensional row vector, the outer product can be represented as:
$$ \textbf{C} = \textbf{A} \otimes \textbf{B} = \textbf{A} \cdot \textbf{B}^T$$

This operation is quite versatile and finds applications in various domains, especially in fields like quantum mechanics, signal processing, and statistics. It's used for tasks such as calculating covariance matrices, defining tensors, and performing transformations in certain machine learning algorithms.

Understanding the outer product is crucial because it helps in grasping concepts like tensor products, which are extensions of this operation to more complex structures in linear algebra and beyond.
