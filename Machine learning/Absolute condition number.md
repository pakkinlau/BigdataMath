**Concept:** Absolute Condition Number in Linear Algebra

**Context:** Linear Algebra

---

**Introduction:**
In the realm of linear algebra, understanding the sensitivity of a mathematical problem concerning small changes in its inputs is crucial. This sensitivity is often quantified by a mathematical metric known as the **absolute condition numb0er**. It is a fundamental concept used to measure how errors in the input data of a mathematical problem translate into errors in the output.

**Definition:**
The absolute condition number of a function or a mathematical problem measures how much the output of the function can change for a small change in its input, expressed in absolute terms. In the context of linear algebra, it is applied to matrices and linear systems to assess their stability under perturbations in the input data.

It looks like you're delving into the concept of the absolute condition number in the context of functions and their derivatives. Here's a revised version:

**Definition: The Absolute Condition Number**

An algorithm can be represented as a mapping $f: X \rightarrow Y$, where perturbations, denoted as $\delta x$, can influence the function's output, reflected in $\delta f$: $f(x + \delta x) - f(x)$.

The absolute condition number, often symbolized as $\kappa$, for a function $f(x)$ is defined as:
$$\hat \kappa = \lim_{{\epsilon \to 0}} \sup \left( \frac{{|f(x + \epsilon) - f(x)|}}{{|\epsilon|}} \right)$$

It can also be expressed as:
$$\hat \kappa = \underset{\delta x}{\sup} \frac{{|| \delta f||}}{{|| \delta x||}}$$

For infinitesimal $\delta x$, where $J$ is the Jacobian matrix of $f(x)$, the approximation $\delta f \approx J(x) \delta x$ holds. Thus, the condition number can be estimated as $\hat \kappa = ||J(x)||$, where the norm refers to the matrix form.

- When $||J(x)||$ grows, it indicates that the linear transformation might encounter regions where the gradient is significantly large, potentially leading to inaccurate results.
- The term "supremum" is not explicitly required since it relies on the norm of the Jacobian matrix $J(x)$ calculated at a specific point $x$. This matrix norm offers insight into the local behavior of the function around the given point.

The absolute condition number provides a valuable understanding of how small changes in the input might affect the output, particularly in scenarios where the Jacobian matrix norm is substantial, signifying potential sensitivity to perturbations.

Is there any particular aspect you'd like me to focus on or elaborate further?

- $\kappa$ pronounced as "kappa"
- The idea is similar to taking derivative around the change of function. 
- $sup$ is the biggest number of the set of gradient of such linear transformation in its domain. 

**Significance:**
1. **Numerical Stability:** Absolute condition number helps determine the stability of algorithms used to solve linear systems. A lower condition number indicates a well-conditioned problem, meaning small changes in input lead to proportionally small changes in output.
  
2. **Ill-Conditioned Problems:** Problems with high absolute condition numbers are termed "ill-conditioned." These are problematic in numerical computations as they magnify errors and lead to inaccurate results. Identifying such problems is vital in practical applications.

3. **Precision Analysis:** Understanding the absolute condition number is essential when dealing with limited precision arithmetic in computational applications. It aids in predicting the loss of precision in the computed results.

**Examples:**
1. **Matrix Inversion:** Consider a linear system $Ax = b$ where $A$ is a matrix. If $A$ has a high absolute condition number, small changes in $A$ or $b$ can lead to significant changes in the solution $x$, making the system ill-conditioned.

2. **Eigenvalue Problems:** Computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix involve algorithms sensitive to the matrix's condition number. High condition numbers indicate a delicate balance between the matrix's components, requiring careful numerical techniques for accurate solutions.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the absolute condition number in linear algebra provides invaluable insights into the stability and accuracy of numerical computations involving matrices and linear systems. By evaluating the sensitivity of a problem to input variations, mathematicians and computer scientists can develop robust algorithms, ensuring accurate results even in the face of computational limitations and small perturbations in data.

### Derivation

Certainly, I'll rewrite the explanation to include the notion of the supremum in the expression for the absolute condition number.

Consider a function $f(x)$ that maps a vector $x$ to another vector $f(x)$. The absolute condition number $\kappa$ measures how much the output $f(x)$ can change for a small change in the input $x$, expressed in absolute terms. Formally, $\kappa$ is defined as the supremum of the following ratio as $\epsilon$ approaches 0:
$$ \kappa = \sup \left( \frac{{\| f(x + \epsilon) - f(x) \|}}{{\| \epsilon \|}} \right)$$

Here,
- $\epsilon$ represents the perturbation in the input $x$.
- $\| \epsilon \|$ represents the norm of the perturbation vector, measuring the size of the change in input.
- $\| f(x + \epsilon) - f(x) \|$ represents the norm of the change in output, indicating how much the function output changes due to the input perturbation.

The supremum is used to find the smallest number that is an upper bound for all possible ratios of output changes to input changes. Taking the supremum ensures that we consider the maximum possible amplification of errors in the output due to errors in the input, making it a robust measure of the problem's sensitivity to perturbations.

This definition of the absolute condition number provides a precise and rigorous way to quantify the stability and sensitivity of mathematical problems, especially in numerical analysis and scientific computing.
