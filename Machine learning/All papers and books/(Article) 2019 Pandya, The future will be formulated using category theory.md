- While the earth is a closed system for matter but an open system for energy, the human body is considered an open system. There is a growing belief that the current understanding of science cannot wholly explain human life, mind, and consciousness, nor can it explain the nature and origin of life, matter, the environment, the universe, and reality. 
- Perhaps there is a need for a new ontological model of reality to look into the mysteries of the universe beyond the human ecosystem in cyberspace, aquaspace, geospace, and space (CAGS).

- The universe is understood to be made of mathematics. Mathematics is primarily about rules and patterns, and science is about discovering and documenting rules and patterns that occur in nature. 


- 1. mathematical laws is giving us a reference model for understanding the interconnectedness and interdependencies of the human ecosystem.
	- As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states: “Roughly, [[category theory|category theory]] is a general mathematical theory of structures and of systems of structures… At a minimum, it is a powerful language, or conceptual framework, allowing us to see the universal components of a family of structures of a given kind, and how the structures of different kinds are interrelated. Category theory is both an interesting object of philosophical study, and a potentially powerful formal tool for philosophical investigations of concepts such as space, system, and even truth.”

- 2. Category theory is already becoming a key driver for current mathematics and academic computer science and is beginning to be applied to mathematical physics. 
	- As category theory becomes the language of mathematics for the articulation of the laws of physics, there is a hope that it will help us in defining and designing the open systems in the human ecosystem that can assist us on our journey towards understanding the origin of our universe and our place within it.

- Prof. (Dr.) John Carlos Baez, an American mathematical physicist and a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Riverside participates in Risk Roundup to discuss Category Theory.


- 1. Based on the "Mathematical Universe Hypothesis", the emerging reality is that we live in a "relational reality". 
	- It means that the properties of the biosphere around us stem not from properties of its ultimate building blocks, but from the relations among these building blocks. 
	- While the position of category theory as a foundational language in applied mathematics and mathematical modeling is still in its infancy and a rather unexplored path, it is crucial to understand how it can help us understand the complex problems facing humanity.
- 2. The systems and structures we look at in the universe are self-organized at several different levels. 
- 3. We live in a relational reality where self-organization is an obvious principle which is embedded in our description of the universe. 
	- This means that the properties of the world around us stem not from properties of its ultimate building blocks or individual units, but from the relations among these building blocks and units.

- Category theory application
	- 1. From assisting us in understanding how patterns of innovation rise to how patterns of destruction develop, category theory has the potential to be a powerful language or conceptual framework on which we can formulate our collective future.
	- 2. By keeping category theory as a reference model, we are more able to see the common components of a family of structures of any given kind that will finally help us understand how constructive and destructive structures and behavior are interrelated and integrated. 
	- 3. Now, processes are universal, but we don’t look at our human ecosystem in the form of processes. So we should. 


- Reductionism: It states that the whole is composed of simpler parts yielding discreteness and that the study of the whole can be reduced to the study of its parts
	- understand the cause and effect of individual human behavior, and its impact on the collective human species since the nature of reality in the human ecosystem is inherently and inevitably dual. 
	-  Since particle-like and wave-like behaviors are inextricably connected, they must be inherent in any design and development of open systems.
