1. [[(Course) Andrew Ng's advice on reading research papers]]
2. Draw lines, frames to classify different parts of the paper.
3. Annotate key ideas on the left edge of the paper.


## Guideline of writing review:
- 1. Follow [[(Course) Andrew Ng's advice on reading research papers]] to read papers
- 2. All lines of my paper extracts should have a proper note that are trying to capture that line, otherwise that would be a huge information loss.
	- eg: 
		- Abstract -- we have point A, B ,C
		- and I should mark related notes after point A,B,C.
