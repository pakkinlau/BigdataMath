- In mathematics, informal logic and argument mapping, a lemma (plural lemmas or lemmata) is a generally minor, proven proposition which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result.
- In logic, say P $\rightarrow$ Q, elements P and Q are "proposition". arrows are inplications. 

- Usually what is implied (i.e. the codomain of P $\rightarrow$ Q) is more important when we are using the lemma, while P is the tail of the logical pair that allow us to verify the correctness of Q. (written by me).

- Writing out "Lemma" for each mathematical "proposition" is a good habits, because:
	- 1. It provides a "interface" of a mathmatical article, which highlights which parts are the conditions / assumptions P, and which parts are the functionalities Q.
