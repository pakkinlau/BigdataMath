- Round 1: 
	- [[Knowledge graph completion]]: 
		- Abstract: 
		- [[Knowledge graph completion]]
			- Goal: complete the structure of [[knowledge graph]] by predicting the missing entities or relationships in knowledge graph and mining unknown facts.
		- Definition of KGC
		- Application:
			- In recent years, knowledge graph, as a semantic network, has been widely used in natural language processing, intelligent question answering system, intelligent recommendation system and so forth. 
		- Accompany technologies:
			- [[Deep|deep learning]], [[big data]]
		- Types of KGC
		- existing technologies for KGC
			- Traditional
				- Rule-based reasoning method
				- Probability graph model (Markov logic network, graph computation based method)
			- Representation learning based methods
				- Translation model based methods
				- Semantic matching model based methods
			- Neural network model based methods
		- Advantages and disadvantages of these KGC technologies
		- Main challenges and problems faced by the KGC
		- Potential research direction.

- Figure:
	- Different kinds of translation model (TransE, TransH, etc..)
	- Different kinds of semantic matching model (RESCAL, HolE, SME, HolE, etc..)
	- Different kinds of NN model (ConvE, SACN, GCN, R-GCN, etc..)

- Tables:
	- Summarize functions, regularization, characteristics of 3 classes of figures

- Performance comparison:
	- PPI score

- Problems of knowledge graph completion


- Applications of KGC:

## Round 2: 

- Classification of knowledge graphs:
	- Context form: 
		- Text knowledge graph / visual knowledge graph / multi-modality knowledge graph
	- Domain scope:
		- General knowledge graph / domain specific knowledge graph
	-
