Ch1:

- Composition is the essence of programming
- How do we solve problems? Decompose bigger problems into smaller problems. 
- Then comes the essence of programming: compose those pieces of code to create solutions to larger problems. Decomposition wouldn't make sense if we weren't able to put the pieces back together. 
- Human brain has limited short term memory, and human are unable to deal with the soup of objects, or the spaghetti of code. 
- Chuck = beautiful code
	- We often describe some piece of code as elegant or beautiful, but what we really mean is that itâ€™s easy to process by our limited human minds.
