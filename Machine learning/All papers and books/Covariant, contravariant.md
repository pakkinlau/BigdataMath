- Covariance and contravariance is describing how the quantitative description of certain geometric or physical entities changes with a change of basis (R1)
- In modern mathematical notation, the role is sometimes swapped. (R1)
- Covariant vector / cotangent vector(i.e. covector): It has components that co-vary with a change of basis. That is, the components must be transformed by the same matrix as the change of basis matrix. (eg: meter to centimeter --> basis vector x 100, then the components of covectors co-vary with the change of basis. )

- eg: 
	- physics
		- contravariant: 
			- Changing the scale from meters to centimeters, the velocity vector is multiplied by 100. In general, a vector changes scale inversely to changes in scale to the reference axes. As a result, a vcetor often has units of distance or distance with other units (R1)
