- Nonlinearity is a huge problem in dynamical system, and we are start studying it. 
- If $f$ is linear, all things simple. A canonical closed form solution. We could just write down the solution and go home. We are all be out of business. Non-linearity is what give us job security, and this is the real challenge in many systems. Even small amounts of non-linearity make it so there are not closed form solutions in general. 
- There are special classes of nonlinear systems, and special solutions that you can find. But there is no generic one size fits all nonlinearity theory, or nonlinear dynamical systems. 
- And most systems we care about are nonlinear.
