- In mathematics, an indicator function or a characteristic function of a subset of a set is a function that maps elements of the subset to one, and all other elements to zero.

- That is , if $A$ is a subset of some set $X$, one has $1_A(x) = 1$ if $x \in A$ and $1_A(x)=0$otherwise, where $1_A$ is a common notation for the indicator function. 


$1_A(x) :=\begin{cases} 1,\ if\ x \in A, \\ 0,\ if\ x \notin A \end{cases}$
