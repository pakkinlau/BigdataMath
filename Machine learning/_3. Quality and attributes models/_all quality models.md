 - What should be included?
	 - Unchanged outputs from a process. The factual setup of a dataset. 
	 - "All comparison" should be put in this folder. 

- Checklist: 
	- Create alias for each entity

- What is a good model? (my writings)
	- A new branch model (If that is solving one problem that other model is also trying to solve.) should maintaining the performance of old models, and improving some other kind of aspects. 
	- But if a new model that solves a new problem don't have such requirements.
	- eg: [[latent semantic analysis (LSA)]] efficiently leverage statistical information, but performed poorly on word analogy tasks, indicating a sub-optimal vector space structure.
