- The Universal dependencies project provides an inventory of dependency relations that are linguistically motivated, computationally useful and cross-linguistically applicable. (R2)

- Universal Dependencies (UD) is a framework for consistent [[annotation]] of grammar ([[part of speech]], [[Morphological feature]], and [[Syntactic dependencies]]) across different human languages.  (R1)

- The annotation scheme is based on an evolution of (universal) Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006, 2008, 2014), Google universal part-of-speech tags (Petrov et al., 2012), and the Interset interlingua for morphosyntactic tagsets (Zeman, 2008).  (R1)

- The general philosophy is to provide a universal inventory of [[Category|categories]] and guidelines to facilitate consistent [[annotation]] of similar constructions across languages, while allowing language-specific extensions when necessary. (R1)

- What is a successful UD? (R1)
	- UD needs to be satisfactory on linguistic analysis grounds for individual languages. (R1)
	- UD needs to be good for linguistic typology, i.e., providing a suitable basis for bringing out cross-linguistic parallelism across languages and language families.
	- UD must be suitable for rapid, consistent annotation by a human annotator.
	- UD must be easily comprehended and used by a non-linguist, whether a language learner or an engineer with prosaic needs for language processing. We refer to this as seeking a habitable design, and it leads us to favor traditional grammar notions and terminology.
	- UD must be suitable for computer parsing with high accuracy.
	- UD must support well downstream language understanding tasks (relation extraction, reading comprehension, machine translation, …).

## Community

- UD is a project that is developing [[cross-lingual]] cross-linguistically consistent [[treebank]] [[annotation]] for many languages, with the goal of facilitating [[Multilingual]] parser development, cross-lingual learning, and [[parsing]] research from a [[language typology]] perspective. (R1)

- UD is an open community effort with over 300 contributors producing nearly 200 [[treebank]] in over 100 languages. If you’re new to UD, you should start by reading the first part of the Short Introduction and then browsing the annotation guidelines. (R1)
