		- [[part of speech|POS]] ambiguity
	- Structural ambiguity
		- Attachment ambiguity
		- Coordination ambiguity

		- Solution: Word sense disambiguation
		- Resolving semantic ambiguity is harder than resolving syntactic ambiguity.

- Most word types are unambiguous, but the ambiguous words though accounting for only 14~15% of the vocabulary, are very common.
- 55~67% of word tokens in the running text are ambiguous.
	- particularly `that, back, down, put, set`.
