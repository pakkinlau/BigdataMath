- Guide to master one field of knowledge (the suggested sequence)
	- Compile list of papers (both papers posted on arXiv, medium posts, github post)
	- Skipping around the list. Read those paper in parallel, understand 10% on each round
	- Forget the worst papers in each iteration. Choose 1 paper that you think paper K is a really good one and then spend a lot of time to good ahead. 
	- And then you might find paper (N+1) from the citation of paper K, go ahead and read it 

- Strategy of reading 1 paper:
	- Round one: Read the "title / abstract / figures": many papers there key findings are summarized in the figures. 
		- Sometimes you could get most of the content from these location.
	- Round two: Read  "Intro + conclusions + figures + skim rest", skip "related works". "skip the math": 
		- part of publication progress is to convince the reviewers that your paper is worthy for acceptance, Intro + conclusion is often when the authors try to summarize their work really carefully. To make a clear case that why the reviewer why they think their paper should be accepted for publication. 
		- "Related work" usually are the location tries to please the editor board. 
		- "Skip the math":  Cutting edge papers, sometimes we don't know what is important and what is not important. Many highly cited research papers where some of it was just great stuff and some of it turned out to be unimportant.
	- Round three: Read the whole paper again, but skip parts that don't make sense.

R1 is more focus on the singular algorithm; R2 is more focus on the architecture of the model.
