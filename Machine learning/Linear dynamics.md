Linear dynamics involves [[Linear transformation]]. 
Linear dynamics within the realm of dynamical systems refers to a system where the relationships between inputs and outputs follow linear relationships or behaviors.
These systems adhere to the principle of superposition, meaning that the output resulting from a combination of inputs is equivalent to the sum of the individual outputs generated by each input acting alone.
Linear dynamics allows for relatively straightforward analysis and prediction due to its well-understood properties.

Consider linear dynamics of the form $\frac{d}{dx}x = Ax$

The solution is given by $x(t_0 + t) = e^{At}x(t_0)$
- This stems from solving a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form $\frac{d}{dx}x = Ax$, where $x$ is a function of $t$. $A$ is a constant matrix, and $t_0$ is a specific time at which the initial condition $x(t_0)$ is known. 
- Key ideas:
	- Matrix exponential:
		- The matrix exponential $e^{At}$ is defined as a power series, which can be calculated using various methods (e.g., Taylor series, diagonalization). The matrix exponential shares similar properties to the exponential function for scalars.
	- Interpretation:
		- The solution $x(t_0 + t) = e^{At}x(t_0)$ signifies that the state of the system at a time $t_0 + t$ can be obtained by multiplying the state at time $t_0$ ($x(t_0)$) by the matrix exponential $e^{At}$.

Getting a more computationally effective expression of the solution of linear dynamics: 

The matrix $A$ has the following [[spectral decomposition]]
- $AT = T \Lambda$
When the matrix $A$ has distinct eigenvalues, we have $A = T \Lambda T^{-1}$ and $x(t_0 + t) = Te^{\Lambda t}T^{-1}x(t_0)$, where $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix, columns of $T$ are eigenvectors

Here's how $x(t_0 + t) = Te^{\Lambda t}T^{-1}x(t_0)$ is derived:
1. The matrix $A$ can be diagonalized as $A = T \Lambda T^{-1}$ for distinct eigenvalues.
2. The solution to the differential equation $\frac{d}{dx}x = Ax$ with initial condition $x(t_0)$ is given by $x(t) = e^{At}x(t_0)$.
3. Substituting the diagonalized form of $A$ into the solution gives $x(t) = e^{T \Lambda T^{-1}t}x(t_0)$.
4. Using the property of exponentials for diagonal matrices, $e^{\Lambda t}$ is obtained as a diagonal matrix with the exponential of each eigenvalue along its diagonal.
5. Thus, $e^{T \Lambda T^{-1}t} = Te^{\Lambda t}T^{-1}$.
6. Therefore, the final solution becomes $x(t_0 + t) = Te^{\Lambda t}T^{-1}x(t_0)$.

This solution represents the evolution of the system's state $x(t)$ from an initial state $x(t_0)$ at time $t_0$ to a later time $t_0 + t$ using the diagonalization of the matrix $A$.

Q: Assume we have used SVD mode = 3 in such linear dynamics DMD. So we have 3 eigenvectors (or 3 modes) and 3 eigenvalues (or 3 dynamics). So how can we bring all of them together in the expression of $x(t) = e^{At}x(t_0)$?

A: 
In Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is typically used to reduce the dimensionality of the data before computing the DMD modes and eigenvalues. In your case, if you've used SVD mode = 3, you're looking at the top 3 singular values (modes) and their corresponding singular vectors.

The DMD modes correspond to the eigenvectors obtained from the linear operator, and the DMD eigenvalues correspond to the growth/decay rates associated with these modes. These modes and eigenvalues can be used to reconstruct the state of the system at any future time point.

Given a matrix $X$ representing your data, DMD proceeds as follows:

1. Perform SVD on $X$: $X = U\Sigma V^*$
2. For rank-3 truncation, retain only the first three columns of $U$ and $V$ and the first three singular values in $\Sigma$.
3. Compute the matrix $A^{'} = U^*X_{2}V\Sigma^{-1}$, where $X_{2}$ is the data matrix shifted by one time step.
4. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $A^{'}$. These are the DMD eigenvalues and modes.

To reconstruct the solution $x(t) = e^{At}x(t_0)$, you can use the DMD modes and eigenvalues as follows:

$x(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{3}b_{i}e^{\omega_{i}t}\phi_{i}$

where:
- $\omega_{i}$ are the DMD eigenvalues (representing the dynamics),
- $\phi_{i}$ are the DMD modes (eigenvectors),
- $b_{i}$ are the initial amplitudes, which can be computed as $b_{i} = \phi_{i}^*x(t_0)$.
 
This expression provides a way to reconstruct $x(t)$ using only the top 3 modes and eigenvalues obtained from DMD. Note that this approach assumes a linear, time-invariant system and can provide approximate solutions for more complex systems.
