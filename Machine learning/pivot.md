Definition:
A pivot is an element within a matrix that serves as a reference point during various operations. It is typically the first nonzero element in a row when applying row reduction techniques like Gaussian elimination or the more simplified version known as the [[row echelon form]]. In this context, a pivot is essential for simplifying and solving systems of linear equations.

Key Points:

1. [[Row Reduction]]:
   - Serving as anchor points:
	   - When performing row reduction on a matrix, the primary objective is to transform it into row echelon form or reduced row echelon form.
	   - The pivot elements play a critical role in this process. They serve as anchor points for the operations that lead to zeroing out the elements below and above them.
	   - By strategically selecting pivot elements, one can simplify the matrix and make it easier to analyze and solve systems of linear equations.

2. [[systems of linear equations]]:
   - In the context of solving systems of linear equations using matrices, pivots are associated with leading variables.
   - Leading variables are variables that correspond to pivot columns, and they are typically set to specific values during the process of solving the system.
   - Pivots help determine whether a system of linear equations has a unique solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution at all, based on their positions within the matrix.

3. Matrix [[Rank]]:
   - The rank of a matrix is defined as the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in the matrix.
   - Pivots are directly related to the rank of a matrix. The number of pivot elements in a matrix is equal to its rank.
   - Determining the rank of a matrix is essential in various applications, such as finding the dimension of the column space or row space.

Conclusion:
In linear algebra, the concept of a pivot is indispensable for simplifying matrices, solving systems of linear equations, and determining the rank of a matrix. Pivots are the cornerstone of various matrix operations and provide valuable insights into the properties and solutions of linear systems. Understanding and effectively using pivots is essential for mastering linear algebra and its applications in various fields of science and engineering.
