- Definition:
	- the process of identifying gaps or missing connections between pieces of information or data within the knowledge base. Knowledge bases are repositories that store and organize information, often used in various applications such as search engines, chatbots, and data management systems. 
- Goal:
	- Identify and resolve these gaps to improve the overall quality and usefulness of the knowledge base. When there are missing links, it can lead to incomplete or inaccurate results, reducing the effectiveness of the system in delivering accurate information to users.
- Key aspect:
	- Identifying Missing Relationships: 
		- Knowledge bases often consist of interconnected data with relationships between entities. These relationships could be parent-child, part-of, association, causality, etc. Missing link detection involves analyzing the data to find instances where relationships are not properly established or are missing altogether.
	- Data Consistency: 
		- Knowledge bases can become inconsistent over time due to updates, changes, or data entry errors. Detecting missing links helps in ensuring the consistency of the data by filling the gaps and correcting any discrepancies.
	- Enhancing Search and Retrieval: 
		- A knowledge base with missing links may not be able to retrieve relevant information effectively. Detecting and fixing these missing links can significantly improve search and retrieval capabilities, leading to more accurate and comprehensive results.
	- Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining: 
		- Missing link detection can involve using NLP and text mining techniques to extract and analyze textual data to identify potential relationships between entities.
	- Machine Learning and AI Techniques: 
		- Advanced AI techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, can be employed to automatically identify patterns and potential missing links within the knowledge base.
	- Semantic Web Technologies: 
		- In the context of the Semantic Web, missing link detection can involve leveraging technologies like RDF (Resource Description Framework) and SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) to establish meaningful relationships between data elements.
