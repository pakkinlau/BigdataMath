- 1. Find the spot
	- The spot is always located at somewhere toppled out from a plane. 
- 2. Standing position of the char
	- It should be close to the wall, attempting creates a negative angle with the wall
- 3. Shooting direction
	- The arrow should slightly far away from the "spot", such that the hog would hog on it and also remain a distance for the char to swing.
- 4. Clicking speed
	- Right click right after E. Right click could make the character start swinging at certain radius. 
- in the position that allows the char either rotate to left or right, with a suitable radius R without crushing the wall
- 3. Click E then right click immediately, so that the char would swing around that spot.
