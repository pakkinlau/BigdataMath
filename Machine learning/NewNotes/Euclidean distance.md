- Euclidean distance:
	- To calculate the end point distance d between two vectors $\vec v$ and $\vec w$: 
	- Euclidean distance = Calculating the Euclidean norm of the difference of two vectors. The difference of two vectors represents the distance of two vectors and the Euclidean norm is the way of calculate the magnitude of it.
	- Euclidean distance: $$d(\vec v,\vec w)=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(u_i)^2}=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (v_i-w_i)^2}$$, which $u$ is the difference of two vectors$,i$ is the dimension of the vector space.
	- For example, we have $v_1$ = film, $v_2$ = data, Corpus A has (500,7000) and Corpus B is (9320,1000). The Euclidean distance between two corpus $d(A,B)=\sqrt{(B_1-A_1)^2+(B_2-A_2)^2}$
