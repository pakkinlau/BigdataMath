- What is Algebraic structure?
	- In mathematics, an algebraic structure is a set of elements, along with one or more operations defined on those elements, that satisfy certain axioms or properties. Examples of algebraic structures include groups, rings, and fields.
	- This term emphasizes the ability of a set of objects to be manipulated through algebraic operations, while also implying that the operations are computable.
