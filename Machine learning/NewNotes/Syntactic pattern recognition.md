- What is Syntactic pattern recognition?
	- A form of [[pattern]], in which each object can be represented by a variable-cardinality set of symbolic, nominal features.
	- This allows for representing "pattern structures", taking into account more complex interrelationships between attributes than its possible in the case flat, numerical feature vectors of fixed dimensionality, that are used in statistical [[classification]].
