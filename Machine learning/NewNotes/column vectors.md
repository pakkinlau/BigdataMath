- Definition:
	- a column vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers arranged in a vertical column, hence the name (column vector).
- Representation:
	- Vertical arrangement of numbers enclosed within square brackets: $V = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix}$, 
		- where  
			- $v_1$: first component of $V$
			- $v_2$: second component of $V$
	- We write $V$ as a column, not as a row. 
- Components of a vectors are acting as an individual
	- Each components are treated as individual, and are not treated as vectors themselves. 
	- i.e. each components can be [[Linear independence]] or non-linear independent to each others. 
- [[Dimension]]:
	- The dimension of a column vector is determined by the number of components it contains. For instance, a column vector with three components is considered a 3-dimensional vector.
	- Operations: 
	- You can't add apples and oranges. In a strange way, this is the reason for vectors.
