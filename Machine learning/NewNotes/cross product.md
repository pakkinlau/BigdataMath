Title: Exploring the Cross Product in Linear Algebra

Introduction:
Linear algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that plays a crucial role in various fields, including physics, computer graphics, and engineering. One of the essential concepts in linear algebra is the cross product. The cross product is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors as input and produces a new vector that is [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] (perpendicular) to both of the original vectors. In this note, we will delve into the concept of the cross product and its applications in linear algebra.

Definition:
- The cross product, often denoted as $a \times b$, is defined for two three-dimensional vectors $a$ and $b$ as follows:
	- $a \times b = \langle a_2b_3, a_3b_1 - a_1b_3, a_1b_2 - a_2b_1 \rangle$
		- where $\langle x,y,z \rangle$ represents a three-dimensional vector with components $x, y$ and $z$. 
		- $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are components of $a$. 

Properties of the Cross Product:
1. [[Orthogonal vector]]: The cross product $a \times b$ is orthogonal to both $a$ and $b$. 

2. Magnitude: The magnitude of the cross product ($a \times b$) is equal to the product of the magnitudes of $a$ and $b$ multiplied by the sine of the angle $\theta$ between them:
	- $| a \times b| = |a| \cdot |b| sin(\theta)$


3. Direction: The direction of $a \times b$  follows the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand from $a$ to $b$ while keeping your thumb extended, the direction of your thumb represents the direction of $a \times b$. 

Applications:
The cross product has various applications in linear algebra and beyond:

1. **Vector Geometry**: It is used to calculate the area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors and the volume of a parallelepiped formed by three vectors.

2. **Torque and Angular Momentum**: In physics, the cross product is used to calculate torque and angular momentum in rotational motion.

3. **Electromagnetism**: In electromagnetism, the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire is calculated using the cross product.

4. **Computer Graphics**: Cross products are used in computer graphics to determine surface normals, which are crucial for shading and lighting calculations.

5. **Mechanical Engineering**: In mechanical engineering, the cross product is used to analyze forces and moments in rigid body mechanics.
