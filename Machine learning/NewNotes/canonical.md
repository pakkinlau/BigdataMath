- What is canonical?
	- "Canonical form": 
		- In mathematics and computer science, a canonical, normal, or standard form of a mathematical object is a standard way of presenting that object as a mathematical expression. Often, it is one which provides the simplest representation of an object and which allows it to be identified in a unique way.  (wiki)
	- Difference between "canonical" and "normal":
		- The distinction between "canonical" and "normal" forms varies from subfield to subfield. In most fields, a canonical form specifies a unique representation for every object, while a normal form simply specifies its form, without the requirement of uniqueness. (wiki)

- In [[graph]], it does not have a canonical order of the node.
