- I am writing the application form that is a full scholarship that selecting applicants establish more innovative and multi-disciplinary programmes that are beneficial to society. The question in the application form is: Please describe your commitment and plan in serving in the respective priority areas of Hong Kong.
- My admitted programme is: MSc in mathmetics (big data analytics and computation stream)

- My answer is as follow. Please review it. 

(1. Commitment to the subject)
- While I am waiting for the start of the next academic year, I have independently pursued several courses on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics, including courses provided by Stanford University and MIT, to deepen my understanding of core concepts such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and machine learning algorithms.
	- 1. Artificial Intelligence courses: 
		- Stanford University offered their whole Artificial Intelligent track available online for free. I completed 4 courses (CS124, CS224N, CS224W and CS229) offered by their school. 
		-The courses offered a comprehensive overview of machine learning algorithms, but they did not cover core concepts that they have used. They might spend 5 minutes provided a brief overview of singular value decomposition (SVD) before they introduce applications, while mathematics departments typically provide the whole courses in linear algebra for 1 or 2 semesters. 
	- 2. Mathematics courses: 
		- To gain an in-depth understanding of the same concept (of, for example, SVD), I have to look at the resources available in the mathematics department.
		- Professor Gilbert Strang delivered an exceptional courses of (MIT 18.06) Linear Algebra and (MIT 18.065) Matrix methods in data analysis.. At the time of studying the matter, I became a member an online mathematics community and I raised a lot of valid questions related to linear algebra that did not covered by Strang's book, and the experience was enriching.
	- 3. Software development courses:
		- I I have completed Software design and architecture specialization offered by University of Alberta, but I think it might requires the learner to have multiple retakes to really grasp those ideas, with their practical experience in coding.
	- 4. Research skills 
		- Andrew Ng of Stanford University shared his advice to his students on how to read academic papers. He suggests that students select 5 papers in that topic, read 10% of each paper and take away the worst paper in each iteration.
		- My reading list was about: graph machine learning, and the application of category theory in machine learning and transformer model. 
- My goal before I start the 2023-2024 school year in CUHK is to obtain the software development, web applications and machine learning deployment certificates (total 7 areas).

(2. Plan in serving the respective STEM area of Hong Kong)
- Software-development:
	- The development of the industry of note taking software and how people take notes, was changed every 7 years. Evernote (published in 2010), created the concept of "notebook and flexible notes" and Obsidian (published in 2019), emphasize on graph views of the personal knowledge base, and entity-based note taking style. 
	- While currently the note-taking software, such as Obsidian, offers hyperlinking capabilities to link up pages, it has limitations in terms of note-taking efficiency. And the next generation of note taking software, in line with the product development timeline, most likely will be created in the late 2020s. In my opinion, it would be edge-centric graphs. 
	- I am eager to leverage principles from category theory and graph machine learning to develop the next generation of note-taking software, with a focus on edge-centric graphs and innovative approaches for organizing personal knowledge bases.
	- I aim to achieve a high academic performance in the following academic year, with the aim of pursue a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree to further study this field.
- Education: 
	- 1. Fosters analytical thinking and minimizes reliance on intuition
		- Overall, machine learning will provide a better environment for general public thinking analytically. For fields where individuals may not have direct access to information, such as investing, individuals being misled by unsubstantiated information. 
		- For a person having a habit that would laying out information in graphs, analytical thinking becomes very handy for them. It is almost impossible to mislead them to believe some ungrounded truth.
	- 2. Facilitates effective learning
		- I have held part-time positions teaching high school students mathematics. I found they really like taking notes with graph views, linking up concepts. 
		- Organizing information in this manner, would define the search space for the students. They could locate the nodes they are unfamiliar with when encountering challenging problems. 
- Machine learning engineer:
	- I am particularly interested in knowledge graphs (KG) in the field of machine learning and unsupervised recommendation system. KGs treats all nodes are its neighbors as a receptive field and they put a unified neural network to learn the patterns from it. This technology can be beneficial for customer databases, or note-taking applications.  
	- I aspire to utilize my expertise in artificial intelligence and software development to contribute to the advancement of Hong Kong's technology industry
- Overall, My goal after completing this MSc is to become a machine learning engineer, and to develop a note-taking applications that could change how people write their notes.
