- What is informative?
	- that contribute more values in prediction.?

- Found this adjective in the description of [[feature]] from wiki.

- Q: If we assume importance = number of links ([[Page rank algorithm|pagerank]]). Is a feature of low importance really non-informative or its informative nature is shadowed by other feature?
	- eg: [[feature crosses]]?
