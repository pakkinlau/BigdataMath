- In machine learning, particularly in the context of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the "hidden state" refers to the internal representation of the network at a given time step. It can also be referred to as the "memory" of the network.
- The hidden state can be thought of as a compressed representation of the input sequence up to the current time step. It captures relevant patterns, dependencies, and context from the past inputs and provides a context vector for making predictions or decisions.
- The hidden state is not directly accessible or interpretable to the user or external observers. It is an internal representation that is learned by the network during training. However, it plays a crucial role in capturing temporal dependencies and enabling the network to perform tasks such as sequence prediction, language modeling, machine translation, and more.

	- In an RNN, the hidden state is updated at each time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state. This allows the network to capture information from previous inputs and use it to make predictions or perform tasks.
	- The hidden state is a vector or a tensor that summarizes the information learned from past inputs. It serves as a way for the network to maintain a form of memory and carry information across different time steps. The size and dimensionality of the hidden state can vary depending on the architecture and complexity of the network.
