- What is context modeling?
	- A context model (or context modeling) defines how context data are structured and maintained
	- It aims to produce a formal or semi-formal description of the context information that is present in a It is used to represent the reusable context information of the components
	- In programming, context means:
		- Top level classes of reusable context information, such as
			- operating system
			- component container
			- hardware requirement
			- software requirement

- Cases
	- parsing a grammar
		- a context model defines the surrounding text of a lexical element. This enables a context sensitive grammar that can have deterministic or stochastic rules. In the latter case, a hidden Markov model can provide the probabilities for the surrounding context.
	- ontology
		- a context model provides disambiguation of a subject via semantic analysis of information related to the subject.
	- gene role disambiguation
		- A context model can also apply to the surrounding elements in a gene sequence. Like the context rules of a grammar disambiguating a lexical element, this helps to disambiguate the role of the gene
	- mechanics
		- In terms of a physical environment, a context model defines the external interfaces that a system will interact with. This type of context model has been used to create models for virtual environments such as the Adaptive Vehicle Make program.
