- In row echelon form, the matrix satisfies the following conditions:
    
    1. The first nonzero element in each row (called the leading entry) is 1.
    2. The leading entry in the second row and beyond is to the right of the leading entry in the row just above it.
    3. Any rows consisting entirely of zeros are at the bottom of the matrix.
- Other elements in the same column as a leading entry can be any real numbers (they do not have to be zero).
    
- Row echelon form does not require that the leading entries in a column below or above the current row be zeros.
