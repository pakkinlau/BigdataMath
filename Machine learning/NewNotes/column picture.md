	- plays a pivotal role in understanding and visualizing fundamental concepts related to matrices, vector spaces, and linear transformations. This note explores the significance of the column picture in the context of linear algebra.
- Key points:
	- Matrices as Column Vectors:
		- Matrices in linear algebra can be thought of as collections of column vectors. Each column in a matrix represents a different vector.
		- For example, a matrix A with n columns and m rows can be seen as a collection of n column vectors in m-dimensional space.
	- Linear Transformations:
		- Column pictures are especially useful when dealing with linear transformations. A linear transformation takes one vector and maps it to another vector using a linear function
		- When represented using the column picture, a linear transformation can be thought of as transforming the column vectors of a matrix into new column vectors.
	- Matrix-Vector Multiplication:
		- In the context of matrix-vector multiplication, the column picture provides a geometric interpretation. When you multiply a matrix by a vector, it's equivalent to a linear combination of the column vectors in the matrix.
		- The resulting vector is a combination of these columns, scaled by the corresponding elements in the vector.
	- Span and Linear Independence:
		- The column picture is closely related to the concepts of span and linear independence. The span of a set of column vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors.
		- Linear independence among columns means that no vector in the set can be represented as a linear combination of the others, which is crucial for determining the rank of a matrix.
	- Solving Systems of Linear Equations:
		- When solving systems of linear equations using matrices, the column picture helps visualize the idea of finding vectors (column vectors) that can be linearly combined to match a target vector.
		- The solutions to such systems can be found by determining whether the target vector is within the span of the column vectors in the coefficient matrix.
	- Geometric Interpretation:
		- The column picture provides a geometric perspective to linear algebra, making it easier to understand concepts such as linear independence, rank, and the behavior of linear transformations in vector spaces.

## Strang's lecture

- A combination of $n$ columns of $A$ produce the vector $B$
- This is a vector equation $x_1a_1 + \dots + x_na_n = b$. The columns of $A$ are $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$.
- When $b=0$, a combination $Ax$ of the columns is zero: one possibility of $x = (0, \dots, 0)$.
	- What's the meaning of $Ax = b$?
- The column picture combines the column vectors on the left side to produce the vector b on the right side.

- Fig: Column picture. 
	- We have separate vectors generated by the column, and then multiply these columns to form a new vector. 
	- In column picture, we why we can draw columns as vectors?
