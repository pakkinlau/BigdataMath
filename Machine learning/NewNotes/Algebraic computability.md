- Superset: [[Algebraic structure]]

- What is Algebraic computability?
	- 



- Enable the machine or human agent to perform inference with the graph. 
- Some example is JSON, XML etc. These formats is like key-value pairs, that sticks one label to one value. Query language could search on the data based on those "attributes".
- With computable notes, we can build up some more advanced applications like, generating notes for a concept + multiple sources of handout copies related to that concepts, that generate a much more sense making notes.
