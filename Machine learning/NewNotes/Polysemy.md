- Definition:
	- It is a linguistic phenomenon in which a single word or phrase has multiple related meanings or interpretations based on the context in which it is used. 
	- It is a common occurrence in natural languages and can lead to ambiguity in communication. Polysemy arises due to the inherent flexibility and adaptability of human language, which allows words to take on different shades of meaning depending on the specific situation in which they are employed.
- Key points
	1. Context-dependent nature: The various meanings of a polysemous word are typically related and connected by a common underlying concept. However, the specific meaning is disambiguated based on the context in which the word is used. This context may include surrounding words, grammatical structure, and the overall discourse.
	2. Related senses: Polysemy involves related senses, which means that the multiple meanings of a word are not completely unrelated or arbitrary. There is usually a semantic connection between the different senses, making them part of a cohesive network of meanings.
	3. Semantic evolution: Polysemy can sometimes be the result of semantic shifts over time. A word may acquire new meanings or expand its scope of usage through metaphorical extensions or changes in social and cultural contexts.
	4. Challenges in language processing: For natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, or sentiment analysis, polysemy poses challenges. Determining the correct sense of a polysemous word is crucial to accurately comprehend and interpret text.
	5. Lexical ambiguity vs. structural ambiguity: It is essential to distinguish between lexical ambiguity and structural ambiguity. Lexical ambiguity arises from polysemy, where a word itself has multiple meanings. Structural ambiguity, on the other hand, occurs when the grammatical structure of a sentence allows for multiple interpretations.
	6. Cultural and linguistic differences: Polysemy can vary across languages and cultures. Words that are polysemous in one language may not have the same range of meanings in another.
	7. Examples of polysemous words: Many words in English exhibit polysemy. For instance, the word "bank" can refer to a financial institution, the side of a river, or a place to store something. Similarly, "run" can mean moving quickly, managing a business, or producing something.
	8. Understanding through context clues: In everyday communication, people often rely on context clues to infer the intended meaning of a polysemous word. The surrounding words and the overall context help disambiguate the word's sense.
