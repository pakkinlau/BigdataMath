- Definition:
	- A spanning set is a set of vectors in a vector space that can be combined linearly to create any vector in that space. 
	- In other words, a spanning set generates the entire vector space when linear combinations of its elements are considered.
- minimal spanning set 
	- The minimal spanning set is called a [[Basis]], consists of linearly independent [[vector]].
- why learning non-minimal spanning set?
	- Intermediate steps:
		- When working with vector spaces, it's often beneficial to start with a spanning set and then determine whether it can be simplified into a basis. This can be especially helpful in more complex problems where finding a minimal spanning set directly may be challenging.
	- Solving linear systems:
		- When solving systems of linear equations, knowing about spanning sets can be valuable. The solutions to such systems often involve finding linear combinations of vectors, and understanding spanning sets can help simplify this process.

- Connections:
	- [[Linear independence]]:
		- Learning about spanning sets is often a precursor to learning about linear independence, another crucial concept in linear algebra.



- Applications:
	- Quantum Mechanics: 
		- In quantum mechanics, spanning sets are used to describe the basis states of a quantum system. These basis states are combined to form any arbitrary state within the system, allowing physicists to analyze and understand complex quantum systems.
	- Structural Engineering: 
		- Spanning sets are used in structural engineering to analyze forces and stresses in complex structures. They help determine if a set of forces applied to a structure can be balanced or if it will lead to instability.
	- Computer science:
		- In computer graphics and machine learning, spanning sets are crucial for linear algebra operations. They are used for dimensionality reduction, data compression, and solving systems of linear equations.
	- Economics:
		- In economics, spanning sets are applied in input-output models, where they represent the relationships between different sectors of an economy. These sets help economists analyze the impact of changes in one sector on the entire economy.
	- Sparse matrix in [[embedding]]:
		- [[embedding]] are often used to represent high-dimensional data, such as words or documents, in a lower-dimensional space. These embeddings are typically represented as dense vectors.
