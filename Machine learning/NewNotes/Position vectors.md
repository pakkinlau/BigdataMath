- They are (The set of vectors that are passing through origin)
- It is common to use vectors that starts from $(0,0, \dots, 0)$ point in the plane.
- These vectors are called position vectors because they represent the position of a point relative to the origin. 
- the zero vector $(0,0,0)$ is on the line because $c$ can be zero.

- Another class is [[Free vectors]]
