- Cosine similarity:
	- Problem of Euclidean distance: We might have two parallel vectors that could be actually similar. This comes from two similar vector, but corpora are different size.
	- Angle between two vectors: $$cos(\beta)={\vec v \cdot \vec w \over||\vec v|| \cdot ||\vec w||}$$
	- Dot product of $\vec v$ and $\vec w$: $$\vec v \cdot \vec w= \sum_{i=1}^n v_i \cdot w_i$$, which i is the dimension of the vector space.
