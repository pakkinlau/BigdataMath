- Superset: 
	- [[_all quality models]]

- [[Global matrix factorization methods]] use statistical data very well, but failed to perform [[analogy]] tasks. [[Local context window methods]] perform [[analogy]] tasks very well, but use statistical data poorly. 


- [[Word representation]]:
	- [[GloVe]] able to Leverage statistical information by training only on the non-zero elements in [[co-occurrence]] matrix, rather than on the entire [[Sparse]] [[matrix]], rather than on the entire [[Sparse]] matrix or on individual [[Local context window methods]] in a large corpus.
