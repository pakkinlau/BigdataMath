- What is collaborative filtering?
	- To address some of the limitations of content-based filtering, collaborative filtering uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. (R1)
		- That is, collaborative filtering models can recommend an item to user A based on the interests of a similar user B.
	- Furthermore, the embeddings can be learned automatically, without relying on hand-engineering of features.
