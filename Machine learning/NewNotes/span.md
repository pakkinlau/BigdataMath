- Definition:
	- Notation: $\langle \cdot \rangle$
		- Such as: $\langle q_1, \dots, q_{j-1} \rangle$ in [[Gram-Schmidt projection]] of chapter 7 / 8 of [[MMAT5320 Computational mathematics]]
	- The span of a set of [[vector]] is a crucial idea that helps us grasp the [[vector space]] formed by their [[linear combination]]. 
	- In other words, it represents the space that can be generated by scaling and adding the vectors from the set S. 
- Notation:
	- If you have a set of vectors $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$, then the span of these vectors, denoted as $span(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_nâ€‹$), is the set of all vectors that can be expressed as $c_1v_1  + c_2v_2 + \dots c_nv_n$ for any choice of scalar coefficients $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$
- Representation:
	- The span of a set of vectors, often denoted as span or S.
	- S is the set of all possible [[linear combination]] of those vectors:
		- $S = \{ a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \dots + a_nv_n | a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R} \}$
- Key points:
	- [[vector space]]
		- The span (S) of a set of vectors forms a [[vector space]]. 
	- [[Basis]]
		- A set of vectors is said to span a vector space if and only if their span covers the entire space. Such a set is often referred to as a [[basis]] for the vector space.
	- [[dimension]]
		- The [[dimension]] of the span of a set of vectors corresponds to the number of linearly independent vectors in that set. It provides valuable information about the "size" of the subspace generated by those vectors.
