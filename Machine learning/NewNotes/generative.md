- What is generative?
	- generative modeling learns the boundary between classes or labels in a dataset. It tends to model the joint probability of data points and can create new instances using probability estimates and maximum likelihood. (R1)

- Generative models try to model how data is placed throughout the space, while discriminative models attempt to draw boundaries in the data space.
