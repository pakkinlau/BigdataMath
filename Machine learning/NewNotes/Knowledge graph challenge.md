- What are the knowledge graph challenge? ^50697e
	- Existing [[Knowledge graph completion]] technologies  are far from complete, but are growing at rapid pace. 
	- 1. [[Loss of information]]
		- It is not possible to convert a natural language articles into a [[semantic network]] without any [[loss of information]]. (my writing) 
	- 2. Hand-engineered
		- While the motive of machine learning is trying the best effort to avoid hand-engineered features, most existing knowledge graphs are constructed manually or semi-automatically by the contribution of crowd. (R1)
	- 3. Incompleteness
		- Because of (2), incompleteness becomes a universal problem in almost all [[knowledge graph]](R1)
	- 4. Relatively difficult to connect and dynamic updating the local open environment [[knowledge graph|KG]] to the outside world
		- Due to the wide range of alternative knowledge (R1)
	- 5. Deep representation approaches problems -- calculation efficiency and  Data [[Sparse|sparsity]] problem (R1)
		- Through efficient computation of semantic relations between E and R in low-dimensional space, the problem of data sparsity is effectively solved, and the effect of knowledge graph completion is significantly improved (R1)
