- What is information theory?
	- Information theory is the scientific study of the quantification, storage, and communication of digital information. (wiki)
	- It is the mathematical treatment of the concepts, parameters and rules governing the transmission of messages through communication systems.
	- Shannonâ€™s mathematical theory of communication defines fundamental limits on how much information can be transmitted between the different components of any man-made or biological system. (R3) 
	- A key measure is [[Cross entropy|entropy]].

- A basic idea in information theory is that information can be treated very much like a physical quantity, such as mass or energy. (Caude Shannon, 1985)
	- Basic laws of information:
		- 1. there is a definite upper limit, the channel capacity $C$ , to the amount of information that can be communicated through that channel
		- 2. this limit shrinks as the amount of noise $\eta$ in the channel increases
		- 3. this limit can very nearly be reached by judicious packaging, or encoding, of data.
