- Definition
	- it means a [[subspace]] whose dimension is one less than of its ambient space. If we are talking about $R^4$ space, then its hyperplane would be in $R^3$. 
- [[dimensionality]]:
	- The dimension of a hyperplane is an n-dimensional space is $n-1$. 
		- For example, In 3D space, a hyperplane is a 2D plane.
- Hyperplanes in [[Linear transformation]]
	- Hyperplanes are essential when studying linear transformations. When a linear transformation is applied to a [[vector space]], it may transform hyperplanes into other hyperplanes or map them to lower-dimensional subspaces
- [[Duality]]
	- The concept of hyperplanes is closely related to the concept of dual spaces. In a dual space, hyperplanes are represented as linear functionals, which are linear maps from the vector space to the scalar field. These functionals can be used to define and understand hyperplanes in the original vector space.
- Separation
	- Hyperplanes are also crucial in [[optimization]] and [[machine learning]], where they are often used to separate data points in different classes. In this context, they are used to define decision boundaries, as in [[Support vector machine]].
