- Scientific discovery, learning
	- Scientists saw a lot of events happening. And they tries to figure out why we can consistently get the result we desire. But we didn't let the computer to do that before because most information we had was not available for the computer.

- What is Machine learning paradigm?
	- Traditional programming:
		- giving rules and data to the computer
		- compute answers by adopting the rules
	- Machine learning:
		- giving the answers and data to the computer 
		- compute the rules (learning)

- Example: recognizing activities
	- Traditional programming:
		- Walking: v < $5 m/s$
		- How about golfing?
	- machine learning:
		- Registering golf with features (visual / sensory etc)

- Feasibility: Why machine learning is prominent now?
	- At the time we have more digitalized documents, it becomes a rich soil for developing machine learning.
