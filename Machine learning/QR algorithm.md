# QR Algorithm

The QR algorithm is a widely used method in linear algebra for computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. This algorithm plays a fundamental role in numerical linear algebra and has numerous applications, including systems of linear equations, computation of matrix inverses, and matrix factorization. 

## Overview

The QR algorithm, named for the "Q" (an orthogonal matrix) and "R" (an upper triangular matrix) obtained during the process, is an iterative method that progressively transforms a given matrix to a form from which the eigenvalues and eigervectors can be easily computed.

## Process

1. **QR Decomposition**: The algorithm begins with a QR decomposition of the matrix A, such that A = QR. 

2. **Shift**: The matrix A is then replaced with RQ, which is similar to A and therefore has the same eigenvalues. This process, known as a QR step or QR iteration, is repeated until A converges to a triangular form, from which the eigenvalues can be read directly from the diagonal.

## QR Algorithm Steps

Step 1: Start with a matrix `A`.

Step 2: Perform the QR decomposition of `A`, i.e., `A = QR`.

Step 3: Compute a new matrix `A' = RQ`.

Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the matrix `A` converges to a form where the eigenvalues can be easily read from the diagonal.

To demonstrate the QR algorithm, let's take a 2x2 matrix as an example.

Consider the matrix A:

```
A = [[4, 1]
     [1, 3]]
```

We will go through the steps of the QR algorithm using this matrix.

### Step 1: QR Decomposition

First, we perform the QR decomposition of A.

For a 2x2 real matrix A, the QR decomposition can be done with the Givens rotation or Householder reflection. Here, for simplicity, we'll assume we have a function `QR_decomposition(A)` that does this for us.

```
Q, R = QR_decomposition(A)
```

This gives us Q (an orthogonal matrix) and R (an upper triangular matrix) such that A = QR.

### Step 2: Shift

Next, we compute a new matrix A' by multiplying R and Q (in that order).

```
A' = R * Q
```

### Step 3: Repeat

The last step is to repeat Steps 1 and 2 until A' converges to an upper triangular form. The diagonal of this final matrix will contain the eigenvalues of the original matrix A.

```
while not converged:
    Q, R = QR_decomposition(A')
    A' = R * Q
```

For a real symmetric matrix like the one we started with, the QR algorithm is guaranteed to converge, and the resulting matrix will be diagonal.

**Note**: This is a simplified demonstration of the QR algorithm. In actual implementation, the QR decomposition step can be nontrivial to perform, and checking for convergence requires defining a suitable metric. The process is also computationally expensive, especially for large matrices. However, this demonstration provides a basic understanding of the steps involved in the QR algorithm.

## Key Notes

- The QR algorithm is computationally expensive, but there are various ways to optimize it, such as using the shifted QR algorithm, which includes an additional step to speed up convergence.
- The QR algorithm does not work well with all types of matrices. For example, it can fail to converge for some complex or non-diagonalizable matrices.
- Despite its limitations, the QR algorithm is still one of the most reliable numerical methods for finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.

## Applications

The QR algorithm is used in a wide range of fields and applications, including:

- Linear algebra and matrix computations
- Machine learning and data analysis
- Quantum physics and engineering
- Computer graphics and image processing
