# In linear algebra, Column space = Range = Image

**Definition:**
- The [[column space]] / or range, of a matrix, is a fundamental concept in linear algebra. It represents the subspace of a vector space that is spanned by the columns of a given matrix.
- Consider $Ax = b$, the matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$ can be think as a linear projection that maps vectors in [[domain space]] $\mathbb{C}^n$ to column space $\mathbb{C}^m$. 

[[dimension]]:
- $dim(Range(A)) = dim(C(A)) = n$. So that the dimension of output data from $A$ should be $m$.  


- Range / image (borrowed concepts from functions, used in linear algebra)
	- Range and images are the concepts borrowing from "functions"
	- Formally, if we have a function $f$ from a set $A$ (the domain) to a set $B$ (the range), the image of the function, denoted as $f(A)$ or $Im(f)$, is the set of all values $f(a)$ for every column element $a$ in the domain $A$. 
	- $f(A) = \{ f(a) : a \in A \}$


**Key Points:**

1. **Matrix Columns:** The column space of a matrix A is defined by all possible linear combinations of its individual columns. Each column in the matrix contributes to the column space, and these columns are often referred to as the "[[basis]]" of the column space.

2. [[Span]]: The column space spans all the vectors that can be expressed as [[linear combination]]s of the matrix's columns. In other words, any vector in the column space can be represented as a linear combination of the columns of the matrix.

3. **Basis of Column Space:** A basis for the column space consists of a set of [[Linear independence|linearly independent]] columns from the original matrix A. These columns form a minimal set that can generate all vectors in the column space. The number of linearly independent columns in the basis is called the rank of the matrix.

4. **[[Dimension]]:** 	
	- For $Ax = b$, we consider the product of $Ax$ is in the range of $A$, and range is spanned by the linear combinations of columns of $A$, so inherently $b$ shares the same dimensionality of columns of $A$, so $b \in R^m$ ( $Ax$, $b$ are linear combinations of the columns of $A$)
5. [[rank]]: The dimension of the column space is equal to the [[rank]] of the matrix. This dimension tells us how many linearly independent columns exist in the matrix, and it is a crucial parameter in solving systems of linear equations.
	- Say there is a matrix $A = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 & c_2 & c_3 \end{bmatrix}$, but $c_3$ is a dependent column, which $c_1 + c_2 = c_3$. 
	- So there are 2 linear independent columns in $A$. 

2. **Applications:** Column spaces are essential in various applications of linear algebra, such as solving linear systems, understanding transformations, and finding [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors]].

3. **Column Space vs. Row Space:** The row space of a matrix is analogous to the column space but focuses on the rows of the matrix. While the column space is spanned by the columns, the row space is spanned by the rows. The dimension of the row space is also equal to the rank of the matrix.

4. **[[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] Complement:** The vectors in the column space are orthogonal to the vectors in the null space of the matrix. This property is crucial in [[systems of linear equations|solving systems of linear equations]] and understanding the relationships between different [[subspace]].
5. solvability of [[systems of linear equations|systems of linear equation]]
	-  Column space contains all the vectors $Ax$. 
		- So $Ax=b$ is solvable when $b$ is in $C(A)$.

**Example:**
Consider a matrix A:
```
A = [ 1  2  3 ]
    [ 4  5  6 ]
    [ 7  8  9 ]
```
The column space of A is the subspace spanned by the columns [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], and [3, 6, 9]. These columns are linearly dependent, and the dimension of the column space (rank) is 1.

In summary, the column space is a crucial concept in linear algebra that helps us understand the subspace generated by the columns of a matrix. It plays a significant role in various applications, including solving linear equations and analyzing linear transformations.


----
- Column space = the span of its column vectors. 
- The set of all possible linear combinations of column vectors $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, \dots, v_n$  from $A = \begin{bmatrix} v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, \dots, v_n \end{bmatrix}$ . It is called the column space of the matrix. 
- The combinations are all possible vectors $Ax$ and they fill the column space $C(A)$. 
- It is also called range / image of the corresponding matrix transformation, in linear algebra.
- Properties:


	- 3. For a $m \times n$ matrix $A$, $\text{dim}(C(A)) \leq \text{dim}(R^n)$ , $\text{dim}(x) \leq \text{dim}(R^m)$ 
		- eg: $\begin{bmatrix} a&b \\ c&d \\e&f \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i \\ j \end{bmatrix}$ produces 2 sticks of $R^3$ vectors. So the column space would be a $R^2$ plane existing in the $R^3$ subspace. 
	- 4. If one considers the matrix as a linear transformation from $R^n$ to $R^m$,  then the column space of the matrix equals the image of this linear transformation.
	- 5. Column space $C(A)$ and row space $C(A^T)$ both have dimension $r$. 
		- i.e. For any $m \times n$ matrix $A$, if there is $r$ independent rows, then there would be $r$ independent columns. 



1. **Definition:** 
	- The range of a [[linear transformation]] or a [[matrix]] is a fundamental concept in linear algebra. It represents the set of all possible output values that can be generated by applying the transformation or [[Matrix-Vector Multiplication]].
	- Range / image in a matrix
		- The image of a matrix, is [[column space]] of a matrix, refers to the set of all possible linear combinations of its column vectors. 
	- [[Span]]
		- In mathematical terms, $Range(A) = span\{ columns\ of\ A\}$, which implies all possible linear combinations of the column vectors of the matrix $A$. 
		- We can see the "range" and "span" could be used interchangeably. 
	- [[Linear transformation]]:
		- Say we have a matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$ takes a vector $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ and outputs a vector $b = Ax \in \mathbb{C}^m$. $A: C^n \rightarrow C^m$, $x \mapsto Ax$. 
		- The range of $A$ (or [[column space]] of $A$), denoted $range(A)$, is the set $\{ y \in C^m: y = Ax, \text{for some } x \in C^n\} \subset C^m$
		- For a [[Linear transformation]] $T$ from one vector space $V$ to another vector space $W$, the range of $T$, denoted as $Range(T)$ or $R(T)$, is the set of all vectors in $W$, that can be expressed as $Range(T) = \{T(v) | v \in V\}$
	- [[dimension]]:
		- The dimension of the range is formally defined as the rank of the matrix or transformation. The rank of a matrix $A$, is the maximum number of [[Linear independence]] column vectors of $A$. For a linear transformation $T$, the [[rank]] is the dimension of its range, $dim(Range(T)) = rank(T)$

1. **Symbolic Representation:** In mathematical notation, the range of a linear transformation T is often denoted as `Range(T)` or `R(T)`. For a matrix A, it can be represented as `Range(A)` or `R(A)`.

2. **[[Subspace]] of the Codomain:** The range is a subspace of the codomain (the set of all possible output values) of the linear transformation. This means that any vector in the range is a valid output of the transformation.

3. **Spanning Set:** The range is spanned by the columns of the matrix. In the case of a linear transformation, it is spanned by the images of the basis vectors of the domain.

4. **Dimension:** The dimension of the range is also known as the rank of the matrix or the rank of the linear transformation. It represents the maximum number of linearly independent vectors that can be obtained as outputs.

5. **Null Space and Rank-Nullity Theorem:** The concept of the range is closely related to the null space (kernel) of a matrix or transformation. The Rank-Nullity Theorem states that the sum of the dimensions of the range and the null space is equal to the dimension of the domain.

6. **Applications:** Understanding the range is crucial in various applications of linear algebra, such as solving systems of linear equations, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and analyzing the properties of linear transformations.

7. **Geometric Interpretation:** Geometrically, the range represents the span of the vectors that can be reached by applying the linear transformation. In 2D or 3D space, it corresponds to a subspace that can be thought of as a plane or a line, depending on the dimensionality.

8. **Basis for the Range:** A basis for the range is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the range. Finding such a basis is important for various calculations and applications in linear algebra.

9. **Matrix Rank:** In the context of matrices, the rank of a matrix is the dimension of its range. It is a fundamental parameter used to characterize the properties of a matrix.

In summary, the range in linear algebra is the set of all possible output values of a linear transformation or a matrix, and it plays a central role in understanding the behavior and properties of linear systems and transformations.
