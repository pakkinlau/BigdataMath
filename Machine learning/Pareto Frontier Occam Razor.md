Pareto and Occam ultimately advocated the same philosophy: explain the majority of observed data with a parsimonious model. Importantly, model selection is not simply about reducing error, it is about producing a model that has a high degree of interpretability, generalization and predictive capabilities


- Pareto optimal solutions (shaded region)
	- Where models are producing accurate predictions while remaining parsimonious (that means higher degree of interpretability, generalization and predictive capabilities.
