- Guideline: 
	- Be practical. Pipeline-oriented. Finishing up with KPI/objectives. 
	- Encapsulates general steps from the details. 

- Structure 
	- Section 1:
		- General control flow of the problem
		- Show the steps, primitives (which means the basis to start with), resources required 
	- Section 2:
		- Link up each cell with a library to achieve that. 
	- Section 3:
		- List out the previous projects that relates to that problem pattern
