- Fig: [[Fuzzy]] inference system
	- rule base
	- database (defines the membership functions of fuzzy sets used in the fuzzy sets)
	- decision making unit (performs the inference operations on the rules)
	- fuzzification interface (transform the crisp inputs into degrees of match with linguistic values)
	- defuzzification interface (transform the fuzzy results of the interface into a crisp output)
