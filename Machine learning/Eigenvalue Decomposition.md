- Requirements for input matrix:
	- Square matrix
	- [[diagonalization|diagonalizable]]
	- complexity

Ideas:
- 1. Matrix composition:
	- $X$ is formed by arranging the eigenvectors of $A$ as columns. $\Lambda$ is a [[diagonal matrix]] where the eigenvalues from the diagonal entries. $X^{-1}$ is the inverse of the matrix $X$. 

- 2. **Eigenvalues (Î»):** 
	- Eigenvalues are scalar values that represent the scaling factor by which eigenvectors are stretched or compressed when operated upon by a linear transformation. They are crucial in understanding the behavior of the transformation and hold essential information about the matrix's properties.

- 3. **Eigenvectors (v):** 
	- Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that remain in the same direction but may change in magnitude when subjected to a linear transformation represented by a matrix. Each eigenvalue corresponds to one or more eigenvectors, and they form a linearly independent set.

- 4. **Diagonalization:** 
	- Spectral decomposition involves expressing a square matrix A as a product of three matrices: A = PDP^(-1), where P is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A, and D is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues of A on the main diagonal. This process simplifies matrix operations and makes it easier to analyze the behavior of A.

**Applications:**
1. **Solving Linear Systems:** Spectral decomposition can simplify the process of solving systems of linear equations, as it allows for the transformation of the system into a diagonal form, making it easier to find solutions.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** In data analysis and machine learning, PCA utilizes spectral decomposition to find the principal components of a dataset, which helps reduce dimensionality while preserving the most important information.

3. **Quantum Mechanics:** In quantum mechanics, the spectral decomposition of operators plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of quantum systems, such as finding allowable energy levels and their associated wavefunctions.

4. **Signal Processing:** Spectral decomposition is used in techniques like the Fourier transform to analyze and manipulate signals in various domains (time, frequency, etc.).

**Conclusion:**
Spectral decomposition is a powerful mathematical tool in linear algebra, enabling the analysis and simplification of matrices through the use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Its applications span various fields, making it an essential concept for understanding and solving complex problems in mathematics, science, and engineering.
