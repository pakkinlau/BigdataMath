- superset:
	- [[inference]]

- It is a form of logical reasoning that involves reaching a conclusion based on premises that are known or assumed to be true.
	- Science, mathematics and philosophy are both using deductive inference a lot. As well as legal and argumentative contexts. 

- Deductive inference is the opposite of [[inductive inference]]. It starts with a general theory and then hones in on a specific observation or confirmation.

- Deductive learning: (For completeness) The problem has been solved, and there are set of rules, and the answer is obtained with a 100% accuracy using those rules. (R1)

- Deductive inference is most often comply with [[inductive inference]]

- Deductive are considered "weak" form of constructing argument for the machine because it is easy, but it is very prone to yield invalid arguments. 

- Deductive reasoning is the mental process of drawing deductive [[inference]]. An inference is deductively valid if its conclusion follows logically from its premises, i.e. if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. (wiki)
	- eg: composing two True propositions like "all men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man", and points to the conclusion "Socrates is mortal", which is deductively valid. (wiki)

## Psychology
- There are different ways of people are conceptualizing this relation.  (wiki)
	- 1. Semantic approach: 
		- an argument is deductively valid if and only if there is no possible interpretation of this argument where its premises are true and its conclusion is false. (wiki)
	- 2. Syntactic approach: 
		- an argument is deductively valid if and only if its conclusion can be deduced from its premises using a valid rule of inference (which is drawing the conclusion based on their logical form, eg modus ponens, modus tollens). (wiki)
