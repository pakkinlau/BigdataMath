An unsupervised learning model's goal is to identify meaningful [[pattern]] among the data. In other words, the model has no hints on how to categorize each piece of data, but instead it must infer its own rules. (R1)
- Why it works:
	- 1. It allows for exploratory analysis
	- 2. It can find hidden structures
	- 3. It can be used for dimensionality reduction
	- 4. It can be used to generate new data
