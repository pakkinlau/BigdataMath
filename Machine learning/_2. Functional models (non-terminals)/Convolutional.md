- Convolutional:
	- 

- CNN
	- CNN also known as [[Invariant, shift-invariant, time-invariant|Shift-invariant]] artificial neural network (1988 concept) , or space invariant artificial neural network (SIANN), based on [[shared-weight architecture]] of the convolution [[Kernel space|kernels]] or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivalent responses, known as feature maps. (R1)

- Property
	- CNNs do not see any order in their inputs, they take advantages of local spatial coherence of images. They are able to reduce dramatically the number of operation needed to process an image by using convolution on patches of adjacent pixels, that is because adjacent pixels together are meaningful, we call it local connectivity.  (R1)
- Favoring data types
	- This design is good for the data that are [[Invariant, shift-invariant, time-invariant|Shift-invariant]] (R1)
