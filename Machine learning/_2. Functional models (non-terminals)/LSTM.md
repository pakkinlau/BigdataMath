- What is LSTM?
	- Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. (wiki)
	- . Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (wiki)

- Q: What is the inputs and outputs of LSTM()? 
	- from [[Graph Convolutional Networks|GCN]]

- Applications: (wiki)
	- unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition
	- speech recognition
	- machine translation
	- robot control
	- video games
	- healthcare
