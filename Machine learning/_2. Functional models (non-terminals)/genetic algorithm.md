- In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of [[natural selection]] that belongs to the larger class of [[evolutionary algorithm]].
- Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality [[solution space|solution]] to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as [[mutation]], [[crossover]] and [[selection]].
