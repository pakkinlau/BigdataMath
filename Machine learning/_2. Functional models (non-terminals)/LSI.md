- Key ideas:
	- Map each document into some **concepts**
	- Map each term into some **concepts**

- LSI could decompose the original matrix into three smaller matrices. 
- It works like an automatically constructed thesaurus.
- To reduce "concepts" from documents
- To reduce dimensionality (down to few "concepts")

- How it works
	- [[singular value decomposition]]
- Find concepts and the corresponding documents
	- Look up which concepts are the most associated with "system", by case it is "database concept", then jump to table 2, and finally get doc1 and doc2.
