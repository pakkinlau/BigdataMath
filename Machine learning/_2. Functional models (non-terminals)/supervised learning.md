- It is based on following core concepts: (R2)
	- [[Data|data]]
	- [[model]]
	- [[training]]
	- [[evaluate]]
	- [[inference]]

- What is it
	- Supervised learning (SL) is the [[machine learning]] [[tasks|task]] of learning a function that [[Feature map|map]] an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. (wiki)
	- It [[inference|infer]] a function from labeled training [[Data|data]] consisting of a set of training examples. (wiki)
	- Minimizing the training [[Loss function|loss]] is not our ultimate goal -- the most important evaluation metric of a model is the loss on unseen test examples, which is the oftentimes referred to as the test error.   (wiki)

- [[Data|data]]
	- In supervised learning, each example is a _pair_ consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the _supervisory signal_).  (wiki)
