- I think it is applicable to [[Invariant, shift-invariant, time-invariant|shift-invariant]] objects prediction (eg: images). 

- Consequence
	- 1. It reduces the number of weights that must be learned (from 16 to 4, in this case), which reduces model training time and cost.
	- 2. It makes feature search insensitive to feature location in the image. 

- Weight sharing method being critcised.
