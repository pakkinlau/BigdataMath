	- Metric and uniform spaces
	- Normed, Banach, inner product and Hilbert space.
	- Smooth and Riemannian manifolds
	- Measurable, measure, and probability spaces
	- Non-commutative geometry

- What is space?
	- In mathematics, a space is a set (sometimes called a universe) with some added structure.
	- Many spaces does not define the notion of space itself.
		- eg:
			- Euclidean space
			- Linear space
			- Topological space
			- Hilbert space
			- Probability space
	- A space consists of selected mathematical objects that are treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. 
	- Points
		- The nature of the points can vary widely: for example, the points can be elements of a set, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space. 
- Isomorphic space
	- Isomorphic spaces are considered identical, where an isomorphism between two spaces is a one-to-one correspondence between their points that preserves the relationships.
