- Superset
	- [[Syntactic]]

- Subset:
	- [[Syntactic dependencies]]

- But, in [[Syntactic]] analysis, we target the roles played by words in a sentence, interpreting the relationship between words and the grammatical structure of sentences. (R1)

- Example:  (R1)
	- 1. Delhi is the capital of India 2.  Is Delhi the of India capital.
	- Both sentences have the same word, but only the first one is syntactically correct and understandable.

- Perspectives of this model: (R1)
	- Words order and meaning
	- Retaining stop-words
	- [[Morphological feature]]
	- [[part of speech]]
