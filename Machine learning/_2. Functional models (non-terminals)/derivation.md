- In [[language]] [[parsing]], The sequence of rule expansion is called a derivation of the string of words, with using [[context-free grammar]]. It is possibly recognize it if the context of [[parse tree]]. (R1)
- A language is defined through the concept of [[derivation]]. One string derives another one, if it can be rewritten as the second one by some series of rule applications.

### formal definition of derivation: 

- 4-tuple
	- N: a set of non-terminal symbols (or variables)
	- $\Sigma$: a set of terminal symbols (disjoint from N)
	- R: a set of rules / productions, each of the form $A \rightarrow \beta$, where A is a non-terminal, $\beta$ is a string of symbols from the infinite set of string $(\Sigma \cup N)$ 
	- S: a designated start symbol and a member of N
- For convention in the book:
	- Capital letters: non-terminals
	- S: the start symbols
	- Lower-case Greek letters: 

- Directly derives ($\Rightarrow$)
	- 1. If $A \rightarrow \beta$ is a production of R and $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are any strings in the set of $(\Sigma \cup N)$
		- then we say $\alpha A \gamma$ directly derives $\alpha \beta \gamma$, or $\alpha A \gamma \Rightarrow \alpha \beta \gamma$
	- 2. Assume $\alpha_1$ , $\alpha_2, \dots ,$ $\alpha_m$ be the string in $(\Sigma \cup N)$ , $m \geq 1$ , such that $\alpha_1 \Rightarrow \alpha_2 , \dots ,$ $\alpha_{m-1} \Rightarrow \alpha_m$ .
	- 3. We say that $\alpha_1$ derives $\alpha_m$, or $\alpha_1 \Rightarrow \alpha_m$. 

- We can define the language $\mathcal{L}_G$ generated by a grammar $G$, as a set of strings composed of terminal symbols w that can be derived from the designated start symbols $S$. 
- $$\mathcal{L}_G = \{w|w\ is\ in\ \Sigma\ and\ S \Rightarrow w \}$$

- The problem of mapping from a string of words to its [[parse tree]] is called [[Constituency parsing]].
