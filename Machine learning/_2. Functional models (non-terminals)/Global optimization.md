- Global optimization is distinguished from local optimization by its focus on finding the minimum or maximum over the given set, as opposed to finding local minima or maxima. (wiki)
- Finding an arbitrary local minimum is relatively straightforward by using classical local optimization methods.  (wiki)
- Finding the global minimum of a function is far more difficult: analytical methods are frequently not applicable, and the use of numerical solution strategies often leads to very hard challenges. (wiki)
