- What is deep learning?
	- 1. Deep learning is a subset of [[representation]]. (R3)
	- 2. where's the data come from?
		- Deep" [[machine learning]] can use [[label]]ed datasets, also known as [[supervised learning]], to inform its [[algorithm]], but it doesnâ€™t necessarily require a labeled [[Data|dataset]]. (R1)
		- Deep learning can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different [[Category|categories]] of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention required and enables the use of larger data sets. (R1)
			- Related: [[feature learning]]
	-  3. You can think of deep learning as "[[scalable machine learning]]" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture  (R2)
	- 4. L-layer neural network -- 

- Deep learning makes [[machine learning]] scalable
	- 1. It is the ability to more and more remove the input of human experts. (R3)
		- Deep learning automates much of the extraction, get us closer to the raw data without human involvement. (R3)

## Why not deep learning 

- 1. Automatic robots: 
	- Autonomous cars, robots, don't use data model, instead they are model-based optimization methods, that don't learn from data over time. Almost no machine learning has been used, except for trivial perception. (R3)
	- Unintended consequences:  When a robot learn, based on objective function, the conseqences is not always obvious. The accidents will happens once it. (R3)
