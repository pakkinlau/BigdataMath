- subset: 
	- [[n-fold cartesian product]]

- We often see notation of $f: R \times R \rightarrow R$ something like that for functions. The cross sign is cartesian product. 
	- Multiplication is value times value returns value. 
	- Cartesian product means set times set returns another set. 
		- Say set A has m values, set B has n values, A x B would have m x n values.

- In mathematics, specifically set theory, the Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. In terms of [[set-builder notation]], that is $$A \times B = \{(a,b)| a \in C \land b \in B \}$$
- If the Cartesian product rows × columns is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form (row value, column value)

- Example: 
	- A deck of poker: Suits × Ranks returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), …, (♣, 6), (♣, 5), (♣, 4), (♣, 3), (♣, 2)}.
