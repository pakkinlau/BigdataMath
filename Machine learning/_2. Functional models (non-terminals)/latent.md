- This concept applies to many fields: 
	- [[Global matrix factorization methods]]
- subset:
	- [[Latent representation]]
	- [[Latent Dirichlet Allocation]] 

- Latent: 
	- It means they are hidden / unobserved. (dictionary)
	- present, capable of emerging or developing but not now visible, obvious, active or symptomatic. This describe the somwhat non-existence of the state, rather instead ofnly a [[Latent representation]] of the input data. (dictionary)

- To factorize high-dimension features, we produces multiple lower-rank matrices, which involves latent matrices. Which tries to projects high-dimension values into some projected plane.
