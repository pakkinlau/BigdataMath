- Definition:
	- NLP is a prominent subfield of machine learning that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding, making it a critical area of study with numerous applications.

- Key concepts in NLP:
	- [[Text preprocessing]]
	- [[feature engineering|feature extraction]]
	- [[NLP models]]
	- [[Language model]]
	- [[Sentiment]]
	- [[named entity recognition]]
	- [[part of speech tagging]]
	- [[Machine Translation]]
	- [[Question answering]]

- [[NLP tasks]]

- The relationship with [[Foundational model]]
	- Language
	- To date in 2021, [[natural language processing|NLP]] has been the field most profoundly affected by foundation models. 
	- The first generation of [[Foundational model]] showcased an impressive variety of [[linguistic]] abilities, and a suprising amount of adaptability to large range of [[linguistic]] situations. 
	- The introduction of ELMo and BERY in 2018, the field of NLP become largely centered around using and understanding [[Foundational model]]. 
	- The field using [[Foundational model]], moving towards more generalized ([[language-agnostic]]) language learning  as a central approach and goal. 
	- Impacts [[Foundational model]] --> NLP
		- 1. skilled langauge generators eg GPT-3

- The pipeline of NLP is creating [[feature]] by performing [[NLP tasks]], which is based on [[NLP models]].
