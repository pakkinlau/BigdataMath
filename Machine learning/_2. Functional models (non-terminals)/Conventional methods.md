- Difference versus machine learning (R2)
	- 1. Types of analysis
		- [[machine learning]] is a type of optimization problem, but it is not fundamentally equipped to handle general business problems (which involve intricate, interconnected sets of decisions. )
	- 2. Applications
		- [[machine learning]] is employed to a range of application. While mathematical optimization across the business spectrum in a wide variety of applications to address large-scale, mission-critical busines problems, eg: production plannings, workforce scheduling, electic power distribution and shipment routings. 
	- 3. Adaptability
		- Mathematical optimization applications - as they are based on detailed mathematical model, and run on most up-to-date data, can easily adjust to changing conditions. 
		- [[machine learning]] which rely on historical data, often suffer from model drift, which refers to the the fact that machine learning models lose teir predictive power due to changes in the operating environemnt and data.

- Find the set of inputs that results in the minimum or maximum of an objective function. (wiki)
- Function optimization is often simpler than [[Approximation|function approximation]]. 


- Kinds of optimization:
	- [[machine learning]]
	- [[Hyperparameter tuning]]
	- [[Model selection]]
