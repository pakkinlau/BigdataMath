	- [[classification]]

- What is classifier?
	- It is a type of [[algorithm]], used to assign predefined [[Category|categories]] or [[label]] to input data, based on patterns or features extracted from the data. 

- Types of classifiers
	- Binary classifiers
	- Multi-class classifiers
	- Probabilistic classifiers
	- [[ensemble]] classifier

### Context

- [[Discriminative learning algorithms]]:
	- ( Linear [[Discriminative learning algorithms]] in the multivariate Gaussian model, under the assumption of a common known covariance matrix showed both analytically and empirically that as long as the relative cumulative efficacy of an additional feature set (with respect to features that are already part of the classifier) is greater (or less) than the size of this additional feature set, the expected error of the classifier constructed using these additional features will be less (or greater) than the expected error of the classifier constructed without them.
	- In other words, both the size of additional features and their (relative) cumulative discriminatory effect are important in observing a decrease or increase in the average predictive power.

- From [[pre-trained]]
	- Use a classifier on the top of [[pre-trained]] model, so that you can repurpose the feature maps learned previously for the dataset.
