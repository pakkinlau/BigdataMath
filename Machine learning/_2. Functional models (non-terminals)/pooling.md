- What is pooling?
	- Role of pooling layer is to reduce the resolution of the feature map but retaining features of the map required for classification through translational and rotational invariants.
	- Pooling is nothing other than down sampling of an image. 
	- In addition to spatial [[Invariant, shift-invariant, time-invariant|invariance]] robustness, pooling will reduce the computation cost by a great deal.
