- Generic regression, we have $Y = f(X, \beta)$
	- Note:
		- $f(\cdot)$ is typically prescribed  
		- The parameters $\beta$ are found by optimizing the "goodness-of-fit" of this function to the data. 
		- $X$ is our dataset. 
- Viewpoints raised from this equation
	- Machine learning is framed around regression techniques, which are themselves framed around optimization based on data. 
	- Machine learning and data science revolve around positing an optimization problem. 
	- The success of [[optimization]] itself depends critically on "defining an [[objective function]] to be optimized. "
- We want to train our model to find beta values by fitting data. 
- Example 
	- Curve fitting is the simplest version of generic regression
