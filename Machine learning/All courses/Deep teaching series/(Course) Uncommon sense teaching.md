# Week 1 -  Fundamentals of learning and inclusive teaching 

- How students fool themselves into thinking they are learning
- Long term memory is in the neocortex, which is all over the surface of the brain.
- Working memory, mostly towards in front on the brain. Like an octopus that only hold 4 pieces. By juggling it, means by repeating it. But it would fools the student that he has learnt the knowledge. 

- How to send knowledge to long-term memory?
- Retrieval practice
	- Before that, links need to be formed first, so students have something to retrieve.
- Too often teachers set students loose thinking, they have a handle on the material and are ready to practice on their own, when in fact their students need more feedback and explanation. 
- Most importantly
	- Students must use their octopus of working memory to grab those sets of links in long-term memory from their own mind -- not just look at the answer. 
- Retrieval practice essentially means self-testing, to build and strengthen sets of neural links.
	- Students have to get those initial traces of an idea into mind, either through your explanation as a teacher, or the explanation of a knowledgeable classmate or through reading. 
	- Once the initial trace is here, it is strengthened each time a student retrieves that idea.
	- When an idea is used in different contexts, the sets of links get broader, learn it, link it. 
- Retrieval practice is not the same as memorization. 
	- It not only improves memory, but also comprehension of difficult to understand material. 
	- eg: student can use retrieval practice to "compare and contrast" the French and American revolutions. 
	- Powerful teaching the book - refers "retrieval practice" as "no-stakes testing". It is an easy way for a student to check whether material is stored in long-term memory, where it should be, for student to use it later. 
- Despite different process involved, students even can't tell whether they have something in long-term memory or working memory.
	- They listen to you and glance at their books at home using their working memories. 
- The problem of example problem
	- Example problems help feeding information gradually into students' working memory.
	- But examples problems are like training wheels. They help the learners to get started, but they eventually need to come off. 
	- The students need to do the problem by himself. 
- Show pictures about how recall and self-testing builds their sets of neural links in long-term memory.
	- Don't tell them to practice. 
	- You can show them why they need to practice.

### Teaching Inclusively—The Importance of Working Memory Capacity
- Berkeley:
	- I spent years teaching EM
	- It was tough stuff and most students struggled. There are always a star students who sailed through the material. And you could almost see the rest of the class melting. They can't think that fast. Other students have hiker brains. versus racer brains.
	-  Best assist all students in the class?
	- Students that learn slower and with difficulty, can learn as well or even better, than students who learn swiftly and easily.
	- Hikers are more deliberate. They can reach out and touch the leaves on the tree, smell the pine in the air. 
		- Hiker need to practice more
		- Hiker experience and richer and deeper
- How working memory capacities differ
	- WM grows to person's max when they reach 15 year old
	- Even as child mature, the variation continue.
- The advantages of a lesser capacity working memory
	- look at real life historical personalities. 
	- Barbara Mcclintock advanced genetic describe the inflexibility of many brilliant people in her field who simply could not change their fixed but erroneous assumption
	- Many genius he worked with remained mired in error. They use their intellect to justify how they must have been right, no matter how the evidence was to the contrary. He has low working memory. Struggled terribly with his learning. Cajal is also considered the father of modern neuroscience. 
- Learning with difficulty often means that you learn something better
	- It is called desirable difficulties.

### Tricks for Expanding Working Memory (Hint—It Involves Long-Term Memory)
- 1. Simply teaching students to read and write itself seems to boost working memory
- 2. WM are like people's height. Good education could boosts WM a little. 
- 3. Racer learner can sometimes get by without using links from their long term memory. 
	- When racer learner need do need links, it's often a little faster for them to create them on the fly.
	- Hikers have to rely on their long-term memory more. 
- 4. Whatever hikers store in their long-term memory can enhance their working memory on that subject.
	- If they study the subject enough to have created plenty of well practiced sets of neural links in long-term memory. 
	- The more a student practices with the material, the bigger the ball of information can become part of the neocortex, and the stronger the links between them.
- 5. Dots represents neurons. 
	- WM can easily reach out to grab those clumps of dot neurons. 
	- In this way, the info that stored in long-term memory makes working memory much more efficient
	- That is why sports fanatic don't seems to have a very big WM can become genius when they talk about sports they love. 
	- Chess players with average WM can beat race chess players if they are well practiced. Because they creates large sets of neurons in long-term memory that can easily pull into WM. 
- 6. Hikers can find shortcuts to a more straight forward understanding of the material. 
	- They are inclined to seek more elegant representation because they have weaker WM.
	- After they learn something, those links can extend their WM on that topic. 
- 7. The more assistance WM gets from the prior knowledge stored in long term memory, the easier it is for students to learn new material.

### The value of prior knowledge


---
- A big part of effective teaching is motivating and inspiring our students, even the material gets tough and need plenty of practice.

### How to integrate a flashcard "retrieve practice" into a course
- The best way to do retrieval practice -- flash cards. 
- How to make flash cards?
	- Q and A based.
	- Use questions to cover the set of information that is going to be recall.

### Inclusivity, Differentiation, and Scaffolding

- Differentiation
	- 1. When Barbara moves her home, she have to learn the same thing. 
	- 2. Mrs. Merkel keep on working on the project that Barbara love. Barbara already knew those skills. It took the teacher a little of time to differentiate the course material.
		- Students have different WM and background knowledge.
		- Teacher: "I can't teach the same material with using different approaches to meet their individual needs"
	- 3. Differentiation is easy. It means providing different ways for students to master the material and demonstrate what they have learned. 

- To encompass to larger audience while teaching difficult subjects
	- Scaffolding - Temporary support that teacher use to help diverse students. 
		- Greater or less WM / background knowledge 
		- It involves
			- How you teach
			- What you teach
			- The assignment you give
		- It allows student to gradually grab to the height that at first seem insurmountable. 
		- For hikers
			- Meet in small groups to reteach difficult knowledge - ask "stupid" questions
			- Break down the steps into smaller steps - that helps lesser WM students to grasp.
			- Match and extend students' ability.
		- For race cars
			- Go beyond simple factual questions, explore in-depth questions
			- Allow race-cars the opportunity to work together. 
			- Don't give race-cars more of the same stuffs. 
			- Sponge activities - reading newspaper on the current topic, building extension projects
- How to scaffold
	- Providing students with temporary support to complete tasks that they might not be able to accomplish on their own. 
	- Break down complex tasks into manageable smaller tasks. 
	- Providing students with prompts to help them remember the steps. 
	- Teachers gradually remove the scaffolds as the students gain confidence and able to complete the task completely.

### Practical insights related to working memory
- should students listen to music when studying?
	- Use some octopus arms to listen to music?
	- Tasks that requires a lot of VM should avoid music. 
- Students with ADHD seems to benefits from white noise and music. 
- Students with low VM cannot make good notes and make sense of the teacher's explanation. 
	- They can end up like robot copying down the material.
	- Which mean the student have to spend a lot of time outside the class try to understand the material. 

- Working memory and note taking
	- Partial notes -- let the students fill the gaps
	- Structural queues. 
	- Don't go too fast. 
	- Take mini-breaks to give students organize the content. 
	- Pause and ask for more than 1 answers
	- Retrieval taking - have students jot down the points when you pause. 

- Hikers are often helped by scaffolding. 
- How to teach hikers
	- 1. Be simple and brief
	- 2. Get students' attention
	- 3. Write out instructions
	- 4. Use memory tricks
	- 5. Spelling of difficult words

- It's easy for racer students to take notes, while also taking in complicated explanations
- While low VM students feel difficult to jot notes and understand the material at the same time.

### Active learning
- it increases the performance of science and engineering learning
- physical when learning?
- hands on doesn't mean minds on.
- It has nothing to do to deepening the understanding the concepts

- 0, Active learning = students retrieval their knowledge
- 1. teacher first give a trace of neural links, when they give students an explanation of something difficult. 
- 2. Can students lay those links by themselves. Yes, but not very easily. 
	- Some explicit explanation helps students gets started. 
- 3. Students cannot listen so long. They either tune out or act out. 
	- Instead they need you to pause, to help them reinforce the faint links you have helped them to lay down. 
- 4. They reinforce those links with their own active retrieval efforts. 
- 5. Retrieval by work on their own, or collaborate or re-explaining the material to others. 
- 6. You might want to intersperse explicit instructions in between the time the student retrieve the knowledge. 

---
### Direct instruction
- It takes advantages of both approaches to teaching and learning. 
- Good teachers have a sense for when students are becoming disengaged, meaning it is time for some active learning. 
- Too little explicit instruction can get lost. 
- Too much instructions students can get overwhelmed. 
- Too much active learning can lead to students floundering around, not knowing where to put their neural links.

# Week 2 - Help the brain build better links for learning

### Declarative learning system
- Hippocampus - help us both learn and remember
	-  remember date, face and concepts.
	- we have 2 hippocampi
	- sized like 2 bean
	- it receive sensory info in the back of the brain and WM in forebrain.
- Students declare knowledge
- neocortex is like 24 x 24 inches.
	- vast warehouse for memory. 
	- neuron dots
	- how to find specific information
	- answer = index
- hip helps find the information with index
	- hips works like indexing system
- every time student retrieve info from neocortex, hip helps strengthen the neural links near that location.
- Indexes suppose to give you the location, not gives you the data..


- I Do Declare, There’s a Hip Way to Get Info into Long-Term Memory!
	- Hip only knows the latest song.
- Neo
	- She knows tons of songs, and her range
	- But she is shatter brained. 
	- She grasp things slowly
	- Neo is not superficial. 
- Conductor
	- It is your octopus
- Hip picks up the song quickly or at least the key parts. 
- Neo though struggles.
