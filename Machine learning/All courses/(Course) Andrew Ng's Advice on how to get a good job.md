- Finding a good position
	- 1. Skills (ML, quiz, coding)
	- 2. Meaningful work: desirable candidate for companies. You can do works + implement.
	- 3. Your ability to keep learning for machine learning

- Area: columns: ML, DGM, NLP, CV, DL....
- Depth: level of understanding...
	- 1. Projects you work on
	- 2. Open source contributions you make
	- 3. Whether or not you have done research 
	- 4. Internship

- Equal depth is not a good way to navigate your career. 

- Terrible ideas:
	- 1. Many freshmen have not yet learned a lot about coding, software engineering and machine learning, and jump to research project right away. That turns out not a good idea. 
	- 2. 10 tiny projects but no 1-2 really significant projects. Recruiters are not impressed by volumes. Recruiters are factually less skilled and less able to doing good work in machine learning compared to someone that has done a substantive project and knows what it takes to see the whole thing through. 

- Build foundation skills
	- Course work
	- Reading (having a community will help you)
- Building more deep and relevant (to cs, ml, ai) project 

- Saturday morning problem (reading papers, work on research, open-source, TV)
	- There is no short term reward for all of these except TV.
	- The secret is to do it consistently for years, or for months.  

- Selecting a job
	- Andrew Ng has some pattern matching for those who have a good success after student graduated from college.
		- 1. Focus on the team, you interact with. (10-30 persons, up to 50.) The team influence the most, rather than a 10000 people in a giant company.  Your manager influence you the most. Not on the brand of the company. It turns out it is not correlated to your personal experience. 
		- 2. Evaluate the individuals, and see if you think these are people you can learn from and work with.
	- Failure mode:
		- Joins a good company, but with a boring team (eg: Java backend payment team)
		- It brings you to career plateau, wasting 1.5 year of that very exciting growth of AI machine learning. 
		- Careful about rotation programs. If they refuse to tell you what teams you are working with, it is not attractive.
