- Common way:
	- Some might pick it up by osmosis (by random).

- Guide to master one field of knowledge (the suggested sequence)
	- Compile list of papers (both papers posted on arXiv, medium posts, github post)
	- Skipping around the list. Read those paper in parallel, understand 10% on each round
	- Forget the worst papers in each iteration. Choose 1 paper that you think paper K is a really good one and then spend a lot of time to good ahead. 
	- And then you might find paper (N+1) from the citation of paper K, go ahead and read it 

- Strategy of reading 1 paper:
	- 1. Taking multiple passes through the paper
		- The bad way is from the first word to the last word. 
		- Round one: Read the "title / abstract / figures": many papers there key findings are summarized in the figures. 
			- Sometimes you could get most of the content from these location.
		- Round two: Read  "Intro + conclusions + figures + skim rest", skip "related works". "skip the math": 
			- part of publication progress is to convince the reviewers that your paper is worthy for acceptance, Intro + conclusion is often when the authors try to summarize their work really carefully. To make a clear case that why the reviewer why they think their paper should be accepted for publication. 
			- "Related work" usually are the location tries to please the editor board. 
			- "Skip the math":  Cutting edge papers, sometimes we don't know what is important and what is not important. Many highly cited research papers where some of it was just great stuff and some of it turned out to be unimportant.
		- Round three: Read the whole paper again, but skip parts that don't make sense. 

- Some questions to ask yourself when downloading the paper
	- 1. What do the authors try to accomplish?
	- 2. What were the key elements of the approach?
	- 3. What can you use yourself?
	- 4. What other references do you not to follow?

- Progression:
	- Basic understanding of an area: Read 5-20 papers then you may be good enough to do some work, apply some algorithms. But not sure enough for you to do research.
	- Very good understanding: Read 50-100 papers then that is enough to have a good understanding on say "speech recognition".

- Weekly practice:
	- Andrew Ng: Having a set of unread papers at backpack all the time. 2 papers for discussion every week. That means he have already read 6 papers per week in order to select 2. 

- TIme budget for understanding 1 paper:
	- Skip anything you don't familiar with
	- People
		- Andrew Ng: 0.5 hour
		- Student: 1 hour
		- Very novel paper: might takes 3 hours

- Strategy of writing a paper:
	- 1. Summarize most of the content in your title, abstract and figures.
	- 2. Persuade why your paper is worth publishing in the intro, conclusion, figures. 
	- 3. Add "related work" session to please the editoral board
	- 4. Use plain text to describe how the math works (because most often the reader would skip the math)

- Source of good papers:
	- 1. Twitter: It is becoming important place for researchers to find out about new things. (Kian?) (@AndrewYNg)
	- 2. ML subreddit (lot of noises, but many important pieces of work do get mentioned there.)
	- 3. Some important conferences (NIPS, ICML, ICLR)
	- 4. Friends or colleagues (slack app?)

- Learn made and code
	- General idea:
		- Art gallary, art students sitting on the floor copying the great artworks. 
		- Steadily reading, not shorts burst. Not to have a focus intense activity, but 2-3 papers a week for the next year than you cramming. 
		- Find a reading group
	- Understand math
		- 1. Read through it, take detailed notes, and then see if you can re-derive it from scratch. 
	- Understand code
		- 1. Run the opern-source code
		- 2. Re-implment them from scratch: that's a strong sign you understand the algorithm
