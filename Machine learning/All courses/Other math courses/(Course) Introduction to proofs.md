- 7 advices to learn this course:
	- 1. Work on many problems
	- 2. Get stuck and get unstuck
	- 3. Ask lots of questions 
	- 4. Learn the definitions, but don't memorize anything else
	- 5. Play
	- 6. Make lots of conjectures
	- 7. Prove everything you can

### simple logical flow of how to learn a mathematical concept
- Goal: discover what is true about divisibility
	- Play:
		- Create 5 examples and 5 non-examples of divisibility
	- Conjecture
		- Make a conjecture (guess) about how divisibility works for all integers
	- Test:
		- Try to break your conjecture by finding integers that make your conjecture false
	- Modify:
		- Play/conjecture/test again as needed
	- Prove:
		- Prove your conjecture by definition unwinding


### Number system 
 - Natural numbers
	 - 0 is not natural numbers
	 - You can in general perform +, x, but not -, /.
 - Integers
	 - You can in general perform +, x, -, but not /.
 - Rational numbers
	 - You can in general perform +, x, -, but not /.
 - Real numbers 
	 - Can be represented in a decimal expansion. 

### Divisibility




### Primes 


### Composite numbers


### Axioms
- Axioms is a list of rules that the mathematical objects that is allowed to use.
- By using axioms in a series of steps, we are able to prove the proposition of why some statement about why the mathematics object could behave in some manner is true. 


### Mathematical statements and quantifiers
- 1. To test whether something is a mathematical statement, try to put: "is that true that ___ "
- 2. Scope is important
	- such as "is '$x^2 > 0$'' a mathematical statement'"?
	- No. because we don't know what $x$ is , the truth of this could change depending on the scope of $x$. 
- 


### Sets
- Sets are a playground to experiment with proof techniques
- Sets are a fundamental way of encoding math. We can encode lists, numbers and functions all from only sets. 
- Sets is an un-ordered collection of objects. 
- Other properties
	- Subsets
	- Elements in sets 
	- Empty set
	- Set builder notation 

- Important rewording
	- $y \in \{ x \in A | P(x) \} \Leftrightarrow (y \in A \land \text{P(y) is true})$
