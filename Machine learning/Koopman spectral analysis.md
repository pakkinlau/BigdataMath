1931 paper:
For dynamic systems, if we think about the Hilbert space of all possible measurements you could take in that systems, so this is an infinite dimensional space of all measurements. The nonlinear dynamics of that measurement space look like a big infinite dimensional linear operator that evolves those measurements forward in time. 
Koopman shows you can essentially life your non-linear dynamics in a state space representation into this infinite dimensional measurement representation. And your non-linear dynamics become linear dynamics. 
And you are trading complexity.
In 1931, people were not thinking of big data

Discuss different methods
- Try to find low complexity representations with good errors that embed my nonlinear dynamics in a linear framework
