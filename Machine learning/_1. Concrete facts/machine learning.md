- Motivations:
	- ML tends to make much better predictions than traditional programs written by programmers (R3)

- What is machine learning
	- It is considered as a type of  [[Conventional methods]] problem mathematically. Both run on [[data]] and require extensive computing resources, and both have benefited greatly from advancements of computers. 
	- Machine learning is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve [[Performance]] on some sets of [[tasks]]. (wiki)
	- A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers, but not all machine learning is statistical learning. 
	- The study of mathematical [[optimization]] delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.
- It is seen as a part of [[artificial intelligence]]. (wiki)
- Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample [[Data]], known as training data, in order to make [[prediction]] or decisions (doubtfully) without being explicitly programmed to do so. (wiki)

- Roadmap of machine learning
	- 1. [[supervised learning]]:
		-  Resource: feature, label pairs. Outcome: A [[shallow]] / [[deep]] [[neural network]]

## Machine learning applications

- Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as
	- medicine
	- email filtering
	- speech recognition
	- computer vision
- Commonalities:
	- where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop [[Conventional methods]] (algorithms to perform the needed [[tasks]]. (wiki)

## Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks

- 1. Subsets relations
	- Neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of [[neural network]].(R2)
- 2. How each algorithm learns (R2)
	- "Deep" machine learning can use labeled [[Data]], also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesnâ€™t necessarily require a labeled dataset.
