- Instead of looking for a perfect [[solution space|solution]], heuristic strategies look for a quick solution that falls within an acceptable range of accuracy.
- In this context, the term heuristic is sometimes used as a synonym for "short-cut" because this approach to problem-solving does not waste time on things that are not likely to produce acceptable results.

- Modeling our thoughts on heuristics and graphics is convenient, but it has danger to have mistakes in conceptualizations, and data and hard evidence is grounded and heuristics evaporate.
