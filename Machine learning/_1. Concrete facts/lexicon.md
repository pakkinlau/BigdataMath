- What is lexicon?
	- Natural [[language]] = grammar + lexicon
		- where lexicon is the vocabulary of a language, or branch of [[knowledge]]; a catalogue of a language's words (R1)
		- where grammar is a system or rule which allow for the combination of those words into meaningful sentences) (wiki)

- Most of the time in the [[parse tree]] lexicon and [[context-free grammar]] grammar are shown together. In figure 12.1, [[context-free grammar]] grammar tells us the rule of derive smaller pieces. Symbols (eg: NP, Det, Nom) and words (eg: a, flight) are all in the set of lexicon. (R1)

- Further classifications:
	- The words that corresponds to the words in the language (eg: a, flight) are terminals. It has the meaning of "they will be the end of the branch of a [[parse tree]]". (R1)
	- The symbols that express abstractions over these terminals are "non-terminals."
		- Non-terminal associated with each word in the lexicon is its lexical category, or part of speech.
