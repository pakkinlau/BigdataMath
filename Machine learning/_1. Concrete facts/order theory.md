- Definition: 
	- A branch of math that study the intuitive notion of order using binary relations. It provides a formal framework: "this is less than that" (MIT)

- subsets: 
	- Linear order: 
		- Given two different numbers, one will be bigger than the other.
	- Product order:
		- Taking the product of two relations is a useful way to construct new relations from old ones. $domain(R_1 \times R_2)::=domain(R_1) \times domain(R_2)$

	- [[partial order]]
