- Fuzzy: a computational paradigm that is based on how humans think

- subset: 
	- [[Fuzzy logic]]
- [[Fuzzy relation]]:

- Fuzzy relational database:
	- Usually, a rule base is stored in a matrix notation which allows the fuzzy controller to update its internal values.
- Fuzzy if-then rules / fuzzy conditional statements
	- They are in the expression of the form IF A THEN B, where A and B are labels of [[fuzzy set]] characteriszed by appropriate [[membership function]] (probably dealing with superset / subset)
- These models have the capability of recognising, representing, manipulating, interpreting, and using data and information that are vague and lack certainty.

- Why its popularity declining?
- 1. There are better tools 
	- Most use cases for fuzzy logic can be accomplished with Bayesian techniques and graphical models. (Quora)
	- If the interpretation of a variable depends on context, then you can just add variables that describe the context to the graphical model. A Bayesian approach has several advantages; everything is formally specified and you can get confidence intervals and risk assessment; those things are harder with fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is much more ad-hoc.(Quora)
