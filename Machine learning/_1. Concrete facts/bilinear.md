- subset:
	- [[matrix]] multiplication (R1)

- In mathematics,  (R1)
	- Requirements: (R2)
		- 1. Involves / combines two variables (two vector spaces)
		- 2. The function is linear with respect to each of its variables (i.e. linear in each variable when all other variables are fixed). 
	- Outcome:
		- yields an element of a third vector space, and is linear in each of its argument.
	- Example: 
		- eg: $f(x,y) = x * y$
		- eg: $log f(x,y) = logx + logy$

- Bilinear layer
	- The $n+1^{\text{th}}$ layer neuron is depend on two source in $n^{\text{th}}$ layer.
	- Examples is RESCAL and DistMult in [[Knowledge graph completion]].
