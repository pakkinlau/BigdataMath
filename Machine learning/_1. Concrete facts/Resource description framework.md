- Invented around 1998.(R1)
- [[Resource description framework]] (RDF), an effort in this direction supported by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), provides a means for the description of [[metadata]] which is a necessity for the next generation of interoperable Web applications.
- Which is invented in 2003 earlier than the model of graph representation learning. The performance of using RDF on representing knowledge is not considered in the design. (my writing)
