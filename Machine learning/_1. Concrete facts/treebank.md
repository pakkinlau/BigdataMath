- Sufficiently robust grammar consisting of [[context-free grammar]] can be used to assign a [[parse tree]] to any sentence. That means that it is possible to build a corpus where every sentence is paired with a corresponding [[parse tree]].

- A set of annotated corpus is called a treebank.

- In linguistics, a treebank is a [[parsing|parsed]] text corpus that annotates [[Syntactic]] or [[semantics]] sentence structure. The construction of parsed corpora in the early 1990s revolutionized computational linguistics, which benefitted from large-scale empirical data. (R1)

- Treebank projects
	- A variety of treebanks have been created, generally through the use of parsers, to automatically parse each sentence, followed by the use of humans to hand-correct the parses.

- Syntactic movement
	- Some partitioning of parse trees that make some long run-on sentences be shorter and easier to analyze. 
	- Example see [[treebank#^5ceef8]]

- Treebank as grammar
	- From treebank like the above figure, the sentences in a treebank implicitly constitute a grammar of the language represented by the corpus being annotated. 
	- Possible to extract grammar rules from one treebank.
	- Example see [[treebank#^6339ba]]
