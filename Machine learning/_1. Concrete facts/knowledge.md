- superset:
	- [[knowledge graph]]
	- [[node embedding]]
	- [[Knowledge graph completion]]


- Connection:
	- Data model (of csp vault)

- What is knowledge?
	- Knowledge pyramid -- Data (raw numbers, figures, words, sounds, derived from observations), information (processed data that has a meaning and is organized for some purpose). knowledge, understanding, wisdom.


- Characteristic of knowledge:  ^5a833f
	- 1. Characteristics of information
		- Knowledge inherits all characteristics of information if we consider it is in a higher position in the hierarchy of knowledge. Information has below characteristics: 
		- 1. Dependency on the context
			- In most of the case, context + word = conceptual meaning. [[context]] provides proxy relations or direct relations in between words to other words. To manifest its own value of knowledge, it must be connected with other  information or knowledge. (my writing)
	- 2. Reusable (R1)
		- If those dataset is a knowledge, then it should be always true in the future.
	- 3. The value of knowledge may change over time. (R1)
	- 4. Knowledge has to be renewed or maintained. (R1)
		- It has to be connected via memory, past experience, expertise, knowledge transfer mechanism, opportunities.
	- 5. Facilitates effectiveness and sense-making
	- 6. Tacit (verse explicit (information))
		- Tacit knowledge (know-how) 
			- embedded in the human mind through experience and jobs. 
			- Personal wisdom and experience, context-specific, more difficult to extract or codify.
			- Tacit knowledge includes insights, intuitions. 
		- Explicit knowledge
			- Externalized, easy to codify, share and learned. Exists in high volumes. 
	- 7. Analogue (versus digital (information))
	- 8. Difficult to broadcast (versus (knowledge more likely face-to-face))
