			- [[Edge features]]
			- [[Node features]]

- What is feature?
	- In [[machine learning]] and [[pattern|pattern recognition]], a feature is an individual measurable property of characteristic of a phenomenon.
- Choosing [[informative]], [[discrimination|discriminating]] and [[identical and independently distributed|independent]], is crucial element of effective algorithm in [[pattern]] recognition, [[classification]] and [[regression]].
- Features are usually numeric, but structure feature such as strings and [[graph]] are used in [[Syntactic pattern recognition]]
- [[label]] is the target of [[Prediction]] in [[machine learning]] [[tasks|task]]. Feature is what we have to predict. (my writing)

## NLP features

- recognition: 
	- character recognition: 
		- histograms counting the number of black pixels along the horizontal and vertical dimension.
	- speech recognition:
		- recognizing phonemes can include noise ratios
	- spam detection:
		- the presence or absence of certain email headers, the email structure, the language, the frequency of specific terms, the grammatical correctness of the text.
	- computer vision.
