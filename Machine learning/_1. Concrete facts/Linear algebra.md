- In linear algebra, there are 3 main classes:
	- Subspaces 
		- (dimension; linear decomposition; counting subspaces; linear dependence; linear independence; solve Ax = B)
	- Transformation 
		- (reflections ; projections ; derivatives ;  take a vector and return a vector etc; Ax = $\lambda x$ )
		- "length" concept involved in transformation (eg: reflection / rotation etc). But don't say length/angle/orthogonal (such association is not healthy).  Those are tuples of number, you cannot take a tape measure to them.  $R^n$ did not have length/angle.
		- Polynomials don't have length
	- [[dot product]]
		- Bring the concept of length from geometric vectors to all other $R^n$. 
		- Sometimes you have to discuss proximity.(eg: engineering)
		- The concept of "close enough"
	- [[cross product]]
