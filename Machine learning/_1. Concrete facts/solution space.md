- What is solution space
	- The space of all potential solutions for a problem. Learn more: [[swarm intelligence]]. (R1)
	- A [[representation|representation]] of the set of all feasible solutions that satisfies a particular problem framing. (R1)
	- The solution space is the set of all possible solutions for the combinatorical optimization problem.   (R1)
	- The solution space of the vertex separation problem contains all the linear ordering of the vertices. Related: [[genetic algorithm]]  (R1)
	- The range of possibilities how to solve a wicked problem that is already framed in a specific way. 

- The solution space is where products and product representations that are targeted at the customer live. This is where product managers usually love to spend the bulk of their time.
