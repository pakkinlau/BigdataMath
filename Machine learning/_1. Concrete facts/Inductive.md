- Prediction effectiveness: [[transductive]] > Inductive > Deductive

- Inductive setting (Generalizing rules): 
	- train/valid/test set [[Data|data]] are on different graph. It tries to fit a general rule from a set of observed instances, then use that model to predict the unknown.

- Shortcoming of inductive learning:
	- 1. The error in decision boundary: if a "nearest [[neighbor]]" approach is used, points closer to the border may be in wrong color.
	- 2. If we have more information, such as connectivity,
