- Subset (on [[machine learning]]):
	- 80/20:
		- training sets
		- test sets
	- validation sets
		- 2 partitions may be insufficient when doing many rounds of [[Hyperparameter tuning]].

- What is data?
	- Data is the driving force of [[machine learning]]. It comes in the form of words/numbers in tables / pixels / waveforms (image / audio). (R1)
- What is good dataset?
	- A dataset is characterized by its size and diversity. 
		- Size indicates the number of examples. 
		- Diversity indicates the range those examples cover. 
		- Good datasets are both large and highly diverse.
	- Large dataset don't guarantee sufficient diversity, and a dataset that is highly diverse doesn't guarantee sufficient diversity.
