- “Prediction” refers to the output of an algorithm after it has been trained on a historical dataset and applied to new data when forecasting the likelihood of a particular outcome, such as whether or not a customer will churn in 30 days.
- For a [[model]] to make good prediction, the [[feature]] in your dataset should have [[predictive]] power.
