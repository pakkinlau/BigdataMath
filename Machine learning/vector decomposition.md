In many applications, vector decomposition often involves breaking down vectors into orthogonal components. 

Vector decomposition is a fundamental concept in linear algebra, a branch of mathematics that deals with [[vector space]]s and [[linear transformation]]s. This concept plays a crucial role in understanding and manipulating vectors, which are essential in various scientific, engineering, and computer science applications. In this discussion, we will delve into the concept of vector decomposition within the context of linear algebra.

The process of breaking down vectors into orthogonal components simplifies vector operations and analysis. It is a fundamental technique in physics, engineering, and other fields where vectors are used to represent physical quantities. Additionally, the use of orthogonal components simplifies calculations and often leads to a clearer understanding of the underlying principles involved in vector manipulation.

I. Definition of Vector Decomposition:
   Vector decomposition refers to the process of expressing a given vector as a [[linear combination]] of other vectors. In simpler terms, it involves breaking down a [[vector]] into its constituent parts or components, which are typically simpler to work with.

II. Components of Vector Decomposition:
   A. Basis Vectors:
      1. A set of vectors called [[basis]] vectors forms the foundation for vector decomposition. These basis vectors are linearly independent, meaning they cannot be expressed as a linear combination of each other.
      2. Any vector within a [[vector space]] can be decomposed into a unique linear combination of the basis vectors. This is known as the basis expansion or representation of the vector.

   B. Coefficients:
      1. The coefficients in the linear combination represent the weights or scaling factors applied to each basis vector to reconstruct the original vector.
      2. These coefficients are often referred to as the coordinates or components of the vector with respect to the chosen basis.

vector decompositions (into a set of addition of basis vectors)

- Process
	- Let $v \in C^m$ be a vector, and $S = \{ q_1, \dots, q_m \}$ is an [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] set. Then $S$ is a basis of $C^m$. 
	- Since scalar x vector = vector, if $v = c_1 q_1 + c_2 q_2 + \dots + c_m q_m$ for scalar $c_i \in C$, we take [[dot product|inner product]] of $v$ with $q_k$ and use [[Orthogonal vector]]
	- $q_k \cdot v = c_1 ( q_k \cdot q_1) + c_2 (q_k \cdot q_2) + \dots + c_m (q_k \cdot q_m) = c_k ||q_k||^2$
	- So the first formula for $v$ in terms of the set $S$: $$v = \sum_{i=1}^n = \frac{q_i \cdot v}{||q_i||^2} q_i$$

III. Applications of Vector Decomposition:
   A. Coordinate Systems:
      1. Vector decomposition is essential in defining coordinate systems, such as Cartesian coordinates in 2D and 3D spaces.
      2. In these systems, vectors are expressed as linear combinations of unit vectors along each coordinate axis (e.g., i, j, and k for 3D Cartesian coordinates).

   B. Projection:
      1. Vector decomposition is used to calculate projections of vectors onto other vectors or subspaces. This is valuable in various fields, including physics and engineering.
      2. The projection of a vector onto another vector represents the part of the vector that lies in the direction of the target vector.

   C. Linear Transformations:
      1. When dealing with linear transformations, vector decomposition helps understand how a transformation affects individual components of a vector.
      2. It allows for the analysis of how vectors change under linear transformations, which is fundamental in fields like computer graphics and physics.

IV. Notable Vector Decomposition Techniques:
   A. Orthogonal Decomposition:
      1. In this method, the vector is decomposed into components that are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other.
      2. The Gram-Schmidt process is commonly used to perform orthogonal decomposition.

   B. Eigenvalue Decomposition:
      1. Eigenvalue decomposition is applicable to square matrices and is used to diagonalize a matrix.
      2. It is crucial in various fields, including quantum mechanics and data analysis.

   C. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):
      1. SVD is a powerful technique for decomposing any matrix into three simpler matrices.
      2. It is widely used in fields such as image processing, data compression, and machine learning.

Conclusion:
Vector decomposition is a fundamental concept in linear algebra, enabling us to understand and manipulate vectors effectively. Whether in defining coordinate systems, analyzing linear transformations, or solving complex problems in various disciplines, the ability to express vectors as linear combinations of basis vectors is a cornerstone of this mathematical field.
