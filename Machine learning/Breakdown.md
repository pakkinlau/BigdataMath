- This word conveys the meaning of "failure". 
- That means "we cannot find a full set of pivots".

- In the context of linear algebra, the concept of "breakdown" typically refers to situations where a mathematical operation or a system of equations "cannot be solved" or "becomes unstable". 
- Breakdowns can occur for various reasons and have implications for the reliability and accuracy of mathematical solutions. Here, we'll explore some common breakdown scenarios in linear algebra:
- When breakdown is permanent, $Ax = b$ has no solution or infinitely many. 

1. **Matrix Singularity:** 
	- A common breakdown in linear algebra occurs when a matrix becomes singular, meaning it loses its full [[rank]]. In other words, the matrix becomes non-[[invert|invertible]], and its [[determinant]] becomes zero. This happens when the rows or columns of a matrix are [[Linear independence|linearly independent]], making it impossible to find a unique solution to a system of equations.

2. **[[Ill-Conditioning]]:** Ill-conditioning refers to situations where a matrix is nearly [[singular matrix]], meaning it has a very small determinant. In such cases, solving linear equations involving this matrix can lead to numerical instability and a high sensitivity to small changes in input data. Ill-conditioned problems can result in large errors in numerical solutions.

3. **[[Over-determined]] and [[Under-determined]] Systems:** Breakdown can also occur when trying to solve systems of linear equations that are either [[over-determined|overdetermined]] or [[Under-determined|Underdetermined]]. An overdetermined system has more equations than unknowns, and it may not have a consistent solution. An underdetermined system has more unknowns than equations, and it may have infinitely many solutions or none at all.

4. **Round-off Errors:** In numerical linear algebra, precision can be a critical factor. Breakdown can happen due to round-off errors when performing arithmetic operations on numbers with limited precision. Accumulated errors can lead to incorrect results or loss of significant digits in the final solution.

5. **Condition Number:** The condition number of a matrix measures how sensitive its solution is to perturbations or changes in the input data. A high condition number implies that the matrix is ill-conditioned and can lead to breakdowns during computations. It's an important parameter to consider when assessing the reliability of numerical solutions.

6. **Gaussian Elimination:** While Gaussian elimination is a common method for solving systems of linear equations, it can sometimes lead to breakdown if the matrix being transformed is ill-conditioned. In such cases, the method may introduce significant errors or fail to converge to a solution.

7. **[[Eigenvalue Decomposition]]:** When calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, breakdown can occur if the matrix is defective, meaning it is not [[diagonalization|diagonalizable]]. Diagonalization is crucial in many linear algebra applications, such as solving differential equations or analyzing dynamic systems.
