- A paper should be about introducing a product, such that the paper has additional utility to the world.

- The quality of a paper should be measured as such (from basic to advanced):
	- 1. Is that "parse-able"? Could the reader can roughly get the idea of the paper, and remain attentive to your paper?  
	- 2. Is that "relevant"? Do the logic coherent? And most importantly, do the readers think your paper is relevant to their own problems?
	- 3. Is that "synced"? Does the author tried to review the works by others that are trying to solve the similar problem?

- The strategy that improves paper qualities: 
	- Make it parsable: 
		- Make sure title / abstract / figure could oversee most of the idea of the paper, if it is impossible, split it into more than one paper. 
		- The idea of the paper should be parsable even the reader trying to skip the math.
	- Make it relevant: To press presure on titles, abstracts, figures. 
	- Make it synced: Grasp at least a few of papers and tries to introduce and cite their works, and tries to discuss the difference between your ideas and theirs.

- Structure of explaining your product:
	- Introducing the problem
	- Introducing the ways the other parties are trying to solve them
	- Introducing your methods


- To raise a problem (an unmet thing), we must first raise the bar
