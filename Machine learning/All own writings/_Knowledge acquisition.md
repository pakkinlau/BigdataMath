- Hint:
	- Maybe create 2 papers separately? Any interconnections between reading/writing knowledge medium?

- Characteristic of [[knowledge]]:
	- ![[knowledge#^5a833f]]
	- To manifest its own value of knowledge, it must be connected with other  information or knowledge. 


- Limitation of NLP approach:
	- Context in NLP could be related to context-windows and global word-vectors: co-occurrence matrix. But all of these tells nothing about context. 
	- Context is what it is not mentioned in the text. 
		- Refer to Edward T. Hall (1976, p 39), A high context culture is one in which the people are deeply involved with each other, a low culture is one in which people are highly individualized, and there is relatively little involvement with others. (R1)
	- Context meaning could improves conciseness of the content, but that might lead to some people could not understand the meaning of it. 
	- High context (R1):
		- Less concise, less structured, higher use of metaphors and set phrases, use of subordinate clauses, less objective.
	- Low context (R1):
		- To the point, more structured, les use of metaphors and set phrases, simple syntax, more objective. 


- Limitation of knowledge graph approach:
	- 1. While the frontier of the researchers are focusing on RDF-based knowledge graph, RDF itself wouldn't make much sense by themselves alone. The truthfulness of relations often depends on the context. 
	- 2. Reading and rapid understanding from a literature is a trainable skill, which trains the agents to detect which parts should pay much more attention to. Attention-mechanism 

- Ideal knowledge medium:
	- a. Individual sub-parts
		- 1. Atomic. The smaller the size of the note, the more likely the exact same thing would not be created again. 
		- 2. Attention mechanism / recognizable formats. Skillful readers know how to find the cue part from the paper. Skillful writers know how to add context-added content to make the literature easier to be understood.
	- b. The whole system
		- 1. Computable. able to answering questions by programming algorithm.
		- 2. Scalable. The cost of searching will grow as the database grow larger. Certain shortcuts should be also created to shorten the future searching time.

- My proposing note structure:
	- 1. A knowledge base should be containing: 
		- context
		- factoid data
		- in-memory pathways
		- formats


- The general step of producing the best version of knowledge:
	- 1. Gather high quality literatures. 
	- 2. Breakdown graphlet-parts out of each literatures, and store them separately under entity sized notes. 
	- 3. Provide certain structured format for each atomic notes such that 
	- 4. Classify atomic notes

- Abstract
	- 1. overspent manpower 
		- While many tools available today, using an article to convey a message is still a dominant paradigm. In such way humans creates duplicated webpages, articles and books by a new author in a period of 3-4 years, for some tiny re-organization, paraphrasing, or a little bit of content updates. 
	- 2. Search for the shortest path for readers
	- 3. Search for the most influential path for writers

- Review different kinds of database scheme. Find whether there are some mathematical theories of database in somewhere.
