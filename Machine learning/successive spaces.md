**Concept: Successive Spaces in Linear Algebra**

**Introduction:**
Successive spaces in linear algebra refer to a sequence of vector spaces, each contained within the next. This concept is crucial in various mathematical and computational applications, including solving systems of linear equations, eigenvalue problems, and understanding the fundamental properties of vector spaces.

**Key Aspects:**

1. **Inclusion Property:**
   Successive spaces are defined such that $V_1 \subset V_2 \subset V_3 \subset \ldots \subset V_n$, where $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_n$ are vector spaces. This inclusion property signifies that each space in the sequence contains the previous one.
- Examples
	- In [[Reduced QR decomposition]], inclusive property spanned by columns helps in several ways:
		- 1. Ensures that the successive spaces form a nested sequence of subspace.
			- Starting with the column space of $A$ (denoted as $C(A)$), the [[inclusion property]] implies $C(A) \subset C(Q)$. This inclusion ensures that the orthogonal matrix $Q$ spans a space that contains the original column space, preserving the essential information in the transformation.
		- 2. It helps in visualising the process.
			- At each step of the Gram-Schmidt process, the current vector is orthogonalized with respect to the vectors processed earlier. The inclusion property guarantees that the orthogonalized vectors form a basis for a space containing the original vectors.
		- 3. Numerical [[stability]]
			- By choosing orthogonal vectors that are well-contained within the successive spaces, numerical errors are minimised, leading to a more stable QR factorisation.
		- 4. Effective iteration algorithm in the iterative QR algorithm
			- The decomposition of matrices into successive spaces allows for efficient transformations that converge to the eigenvalues of the original matrix. In this context, the inclusion property ensures that the algorithm converges to accurate eigenvalues, making it a vital tool in various scientific and engineering applications.
		- 5. Applications in [[systems of linear equations|solving systems of linear equations]]
			- The inclusion property ensures that the transformation preserves the solution space. This preservation is crucial in numerical solutions, where slight perturbations in the data or computations can lead to different solutions. The inclusion property guarantees that the solution space of the original system is accurately represented in the factorised form.

2. **Dimensionality:**
   The dimensionality of successive spaces can vary. A crucial aspect is understanding how the dimensions change from one space to another. This understanding aids in solving complex problems involving transformations and subspaces.
- Example:
	- [[Reduced QR decomposition]]
		- 1. Determining orthogonal basis
			- By understanding successive spaces, you can systematically construct an orthonormal basis for each successive subspace, ensuring that the orthogonalization process preserves the dimensionality accurately.
		- 2. Finding triangular representation
			- The dimensionality of successive spaces helps in determining the structure of $R$. Each step of the orthogonalization process corresponds to projecting the original space onto a lower-dimensional subspace.
			- This projection naturally results in an upper triangular form because the process eliminates components in the directions of already processed spaces, making sure that each step adds a new dimension.
		- 3. Rank determination
			- The rank of a matrix is the dimensionality of its column space. Successive spaces help in understanding how the rank of the matrix changes during the QR factorization process. By observing the dimensions of successive spaces, you can deduce the rank of the original matrix.

3. **Applications:**
   - **Solving Systems of Equations:** In the context of solving linear systems, successive spaces are used to analyze solutions. The solution space of a system lies within a specific vector space, and understanding successive spaces helps in determining unique solutions or infinite solutions.
   
   - **Eigenvalue Problems:** Eigenvalue problems involve finding eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. Successive spaces play a role in understanding the relationship between eigenspaces corresponding to distinct eigenvalues.
   
   - **Subspace Analysis:** Successive spaces are fundamental in studying subspaces and their properties. For instance, the kernel and image (null space and column space) of a matrix form successive spaces that provide valuable insights into its behavior.

4. **Basis and Spanning:**
   Successive spaces are intimately connected with the concept of basis vectors. Basis vectors of a space $V_i$ are a subset of the basis vectors of $V_{i+1}$. This relationship is vital for understanding the spanning properties of vector spaces within the sequence.

5. **Theoretical Significance:**
   Successive spaces are a theoretical construct that simplifies the study of vector spaces and their interrelationships. They provide a systematic way of understanding the hierarchical structure of vector spaces and their inherent connections.

**Conclusion:**
Successive spaces in linear algebra provide a structured framework for analyzing vector spaces within a hierarchical sequence. Their understanding is fundamental for solving systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and comprehending the intricate properties of subspaces. Proficiency in this concept is essential for advanced applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.
