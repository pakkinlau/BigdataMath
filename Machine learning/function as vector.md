- in tradition vector, we write the magnitude of the vector pointing to each basis direction

- function as vector 
	- the basis $e_k(x)$ would be a set of functions that have a value of 1 at each of the $N$ sampling points, and value of $0$ elsewhere. 
	- then the vector notation represents a linear bombination of the basis function.

- when the width of each strip goes to infinitely small, we introduce another set of notation

- other basis is not good. Such as polynomials, they are not orthogonal to each others.
